# Urgent ePA Information

## Procedure
Team

I want to help you with the ePA process where we have seen some issues. 

•	If someone calls in and says they are waiting for a decision on an ePA case, and the status says “InProcess”, tell the caller that the MD has not answered the questions and when they do, we will decision the case in Within 24 hours. 

DO NOT move the case to MedReview. 
•	If you have the MD on the line, then you need to create a new PA and take the clinical information they are providing. 
•	If you have the member on the line, then you need to tell them the provider needs to answer the clinical questions.
•	If you have the pharmacy on the line then tell them the MD needs to complete the questions. 


As always, if the member is not happy or says they have called so many times then please tell the caller you will reach out to the provider and see if we can get the PA completed.
