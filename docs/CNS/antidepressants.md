# Antidepressants

## Length of Authorizations

365 Days

## Grandfathering

Patients who have a claim for a non-preferred drug, in the previous 120 days will be automatically approved to continue the drug. Patients who have taken the drug previously but do not have claims history (e.g. new to Medicaid), will need to submit a prior authorization in order to continue coverage.

## Prior Authorization Criteria

1.  Is there any reason the patient cannot be changed to a preferred medication?

    Acceptable reasons include:

    -   Allergy to preferred medications
    -   Contraindication to or drug interaction with preferred medications
    -   History of unacceptable/toxic side effects to preferred medications
    -   For orally disintegrating tablet dosage forms, the patient is unable or unwilling to swallow the standard tablet/capsule dosage form.
    -   The requested medicationâ€™s corresponding generic (if covered by the state) has been attempted and failed or is contraindicated.
2.  If there has been a therapeutic failure to no less than **two preferred** products for a **30-day** trial each.

### Psychiatrist Exemption

Providers (as identified below) are exempt from prior authorization of any non-preferred antidepressant, or step therapy of any preferred brand, in the standard tablet/capsule dosage forms. Other dosage forms may still require prior authorization. The exemption will be processed by the claims system when the pharmacy has submitted the prescriber on the claim using the individual national provider identifier (NPI) for the provider.

**FFS**: Physicians who are registered with Ohio Medicaid as having a specialty in psychiatry

**MCOs**: Physicians with a specialty in psychiatry, nurse practitioners certified in psychiatric mental health, or clinical nurse specialists certified in psychiatric mental health, who are credentialed via the Medicaid managed care plan
