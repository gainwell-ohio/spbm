4. When to EO 7011
- NEVER EO Medicare eligible rejects  
- Walgreens no EO for 7011. Talk with supervisor about "grayed out OCC 3" 
    - Refer the caller to their supervisor for assistance with COB billing. As we are not permitted to provide overrides. We can remove TPL once OCC 3 is billed and the primary rejects for 65-69. 
- When BIN and PCN does not show in rejection, ask pharmacy to bill with OCC 1. 
    - If pharmacy states they cannot use OCC 1, OK to EO 7011 + OK to send email to eligibility.
