## OH SPBM Crisis Call Best Practice â€” Adult Callers (21+) 

**Follow the steps below when a caller is in distress and stating they are considering harming 
themselves and/or others:** 

1. Keep the caller on the phone; listen to what they are saying
      - If the client says they are going to die or go through withdrawal because he is unable to get a medication due to early refill, quantity limit or requiring prior authorization, check with pharmacist or team leader to see if there is anyway a temporary or "one time" override available. If not, contact prescriber or pharmacy for any information required to obtain an override. 
      - Agent can say "We're looking into this to see if there's anything we can do to assist." 

2. Contact a member of leadership (Sr. Tech or Supervisor) 

      - Ask leadership to listen to call 
      -  Leadership listening to the call will call the National Suicide/Crisis Lifeline 988 
      - Leadership will relay exactly what is said on the call and what the agent has shared 
      - Ask the name of the person on the 988 lifeline so you can give that to the caller before transferring them 

3. Leadership transfers caller to lifeline
 
4. Agent goes offline to create detailed call notes
