# Edit Overrides

## Overrides a Tech can place without reaching out to RPh, Sr. Techs or Supervisors**

**As of 1/10/23, effective immediately**

ODM changed the vacation override policy yesterday afternoon. It is as follows:   

- All drugs: 3 months maximum override  
- 1 override per medication per year  
    - **No exceptions allowed** 
- If travel is in the USA, consideration should be made for in network pharmacies available to fill BEFORE providing overrides
- Must document: Leaving date, return date, travel location (city, state, country).
- Confirm ALL maintenance medications needed during the call (document the names of the medications, if they are only asking for 1 medication but there are more, ask about the additional drugs, **it is not acceptable to say that they only asked for 1 drug- you need to ask**)
- Consider the quantity available/left on the prescription 

**No more emailing ODM for approval.**

**Technicians can approve this overrides themselves.**


**Lost/stolen/damaged** 
- Overrides for non-controlled medications (excluding specialty) up to 3 overrides per medication per rolling year.
