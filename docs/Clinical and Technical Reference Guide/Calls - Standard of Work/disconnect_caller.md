# Disconect Caller / Call Pharmacy

When you have a member or provider call that requires you to call the pharmacy you are now allowed to disconnect with the caller by offering them a callback.
If the caller requests to stay on the line, then you must abide by that request. You may not conference the member in with the pharmacy but please give them status checks every 60 seconds. 

Please follow these steps:

  -	Disconnect from the caller
  -	Immediately call the pharmacy to resolve the issue
  -	Send the callback request on the correct template to the callback team @ OH SPBM CallBack OHSPBMCallBack@gainwelltechnologies.com
  -	When emailing the callback team include in the subject line “Callback for update”
  - Leave a CNTT in VUE360
