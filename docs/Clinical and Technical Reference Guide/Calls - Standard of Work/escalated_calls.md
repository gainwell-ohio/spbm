# Escalated Calls Procedure

Supervisor Call Request
 
Do you have an angry/upset caller on the line? 
 
Have you done everything in your control to provide satisfactory answers and de-escalate the situation?
 
If you have, then place a request in the chat for a Sr. Tech to handle the call. For the Sr Tech in the chat, if you are unable to take the call then you need to reach out to your peers for someone to take the call.  Every attempt must be made for a Sr. Tech to handle that call whether it is your team or not. 
 
ONLY if the Sr Tech is unable to de-escalate the call should a supervisor be asked to take the call at that point. At that time,  if a supervisor (either Technical or Clinical) is not available should we tell the caller they will receive a call back within 24 hours. A supervisor then should make that call back as soon as possible.
