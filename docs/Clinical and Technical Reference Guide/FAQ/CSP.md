# CSP

- If MCO wants to add a secondary CSP provider, they should email: OH_MCD_PBM_MCE_liaison@gainwelltechnologies.com  
  - (up to one additional pharmacy or multiple prescribers) 

- How will plans be notified if a member contacts Gainwell in need of an override for pharmacy/prescriber?  Plans would ultimately need to make a change in their records submitted to MITS for pharmacy/prescriber assignment through their Inbound to MITS file, but they are asking how they will know if Gainwell overrides a CSP assignment for access.  
  - Based on the most recent version of the model agreement, that information will be sent to the MCPs through their designated pharmacy inbox. 
- How would Gainwell like to receive secondary prescriber and secondary pharmacy information on an ongoing basis? Presently, MITS will not hold a secondary prescriber or pharmacy, just one of each.   
  - Outside of the list that they are currently sending you, the MCP would need to call the SPBM Call Center (833-491-0344). 
- The addition (or removal) of a secondary CSP provider (up to one additional pharmacy or multiple prescribers) should be emailed to Gainwell at OH_MCD_PBM_MCE_liaison@gainwelltechnologies.com and providing the following information: 
  - a. Member ID, Name, DOB 
  - b. Provider type (PHARMACY or PRESCRIBER), Name, NPI, Phone Number 
  - c. Start and End Date of secondary provider lock-in 

Allow up to 24 hours to make necessary additions
