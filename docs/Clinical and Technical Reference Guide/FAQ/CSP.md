# CSP

[CSP Desk Level Procedures 7-6-2023](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/kaelyn_dobbins_gainwelltechnologies_com/EQ3E9SbINC5EvEvtFDGa6PgBJSj4YPcLCJn_TWYJbfm-9g?e=csiDgB){ :target="_blank" rel="noopener" }

## Managed Care 

(Not for FFS Members)

- This is the EXACT verbiage ODM would like us to use
    - CSP edits are currently set to a “WARN” status, which means that claims are not rejecting at the point of sale due to using a non-designated provider.
    - The MCE’s may also request that a secondary or tertiary provider be added by our call center agents and will not be overridden by the daily file.
    - A temporary change can be made to the primary provider at the request of the plan, however permanent primary designated pharmacies and prescribers must be submitted by the plan through the MITS application as any temporary change will be overridden by a daily file.
    - Managed Care plans must make these changes and there is no override available that we can put in.

## FFS - CSP Lock-in Members ONLY
