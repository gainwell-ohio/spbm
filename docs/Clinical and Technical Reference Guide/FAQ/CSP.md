[CSP Desk Level Procedures 7-6-2023](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/kaelyn_dobbins_gainwelltechnologies_com/EQ3E9SbINC5EvEvtFDGa6PgBJSj4YPcLCJn_TWYJbfm-9g?e=csiDgB){ :target="_blank" rel="noopener" }

## Managed Care 

(Not for FFS Members)

- This is the EXACT verbiage ODM would like us to use
    - CSP edits are currently set to a “WARN” status, which means that claims are not rejecting at the point of sale due to using a non-designated provider.
    - The MCE’s may also request that a secondary or tertiary provider be added by our call center agents and will not be overridden by the daily file.
    - A temporary change can be made to the primary provider at the request of the plan, however permanent primary designated pharmacies and prescribers must be submitted by the plan through the MITS application as any temporary change will be overridden by a daily file.
    - Managed Care plans must make these changes and there is no override available that we can put in.

## FFS - CSP Members ONLY

- Emergent: Essential to the maintenance of life or to the continuation of therapy.

-	Non-emergent: Non acute or chronic medical condition, wellness maintenance and/or prescription refills that require medical intervention, when the member’s condition is stable.

**Edit**

- **7121**: RECIPIENT IS LOCKED-IN
  - Only controlled medications will have a designated pharmacy lock-in.  

**Edit Overrides:**

Maximum of 3 edit overrides every 180 days for claims denied with edit 7121D: RECIPIENT LOCKED-IN.  The edit override will be provided for the days supply indicated on the claim.

If the member has indicated that the medication has been lost, stolen or damaged, an edit override can be provided for the refill too soon rejection.  

- **After the call center has provided the edit override for CSP FFS EDIT 7121, an email MUST be sent via ENCRYPTED email to CSP@gainwelltechnologies.com.

  - **Acceptable reasons, please do not give this information to the caller.**
    - Pharmacy Closed, Pharmacy no longer willing / able to provide services, Patient Moved, Long term stock out.
