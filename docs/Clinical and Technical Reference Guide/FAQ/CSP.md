## Managed Care 
- This is the EXACT verbiage ODM would like us to use
    - CSP edits are currently set to a “WARN” status, which means that claims are not rejecting at the point of sale due to using a non-designated provider.
    - The MCE’s may also request that a secondary or tertiary provider be added by our call center agents and will not be overridden by the daily file.
    - A temporary change can be made to the primary provider at the request of the plan, however permanent primary designated pharmacies and prescribers must be submitted by the plan through the MITS application as any temporary change will be overridden by a daily file.
    - Managed Care plans must make these changes and there is no override available that we can put in

## FFS 
- Max 3 emergency EOs every 180 days
    - Can see how many EOs via EO history on profile in Vue360RX
- For non-controlled medications, Technician must post in their designated chat for permission from Sr. tech or chat SME to post EO. 
- For controlled medications, Technician must post in their designated chat and then the Sr. tech or chat SME will post in RPh chat for permission to place EO
- **EVERY COMPLETED CSP EO MUST BE EMAILED TO OH_MCD_PBM_Clinical@gainwelltechnologies.com by the technician**
    - If it is after hours and there is no RPh present in RPh consult chat, Sr. tech or chat SME will call the on call RPh to review EO request
        - An RPh should be in the RPh consult chat M-F 7am-11pm EST and then weekends 9am -6pm EST
- If surpasses 3 EOs every 180 days OR member wants to change lock in, technician will send an encrypted email to OH_MCD_PBM_Clinical@gainwelltechnologies.com and CC OHSPBMCallBack@gainwelltechnologies.co
    - In the encrypted email include
        - Member ID, Name, DOB, phone #
        - Who is requesting
        - Why the caller is requesting a different lock in and why they cannot stay where they are
        - Pharmacy Name - the one they would like the lock in to be switched to, NPI, Phone number
        - Pharmacy Name and NPI of the current lock in pharmacy
        - Request Start Date, no guarantee
        - Was a one-time override placed for the patient?
          - If yes, for which drugs?
- Report to the caller that you will make a callback once you hear back from the clinical team
- Once you hear back from the clinical team, it is THE REQUESTING TECHNICIAN'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THAT CALLBACK unless the requesting technician is out of the office, and then the Callback team will make that callback
    - After you make the callback, please reply to the callback team (OHSPBMCallBack@gainwelltechnologies.com) so that the completed callback can be documented properly
