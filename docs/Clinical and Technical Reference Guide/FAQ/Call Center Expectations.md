| 02/17/23** | Starting today our adherence goal for SPBM call center is 93%. That is to say that we expect you to be available to take calls 93% of the time, leaving 31.5 minutes available for unexpected issues outside of breaks and lunch.  We will help you to achieve the goal through coaching.  It is as simple as following your schedule. *You have access to review your schedules in IEX, please notify your supervisor immediately with any issues.  More to come about this including handle time.* | Per Denise Olusala |
