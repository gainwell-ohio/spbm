## Mailing Documents to Member
Gather the documents to be mailed and the member's information.

Send via encrypted email to:

ODM.Mailroom@gainwelltechnologies.com 

Please note: **We are unable to mail documents to a member's or provider's address that is not on file in Vue360RX**

  - If the address the member wants to send the document to is NOT what is in Vue360RX, we are unable to mail the documents and the member must call their local County Department of Jobs and Family Services to update their address
  - If the member would still like the document:
      - The agent should offer to call the member's Pharmacy or Prescriber's office, verified in Vue360RX.
      - If the provider agrees, OK to fax the document via Open Text to the provider for the member to pick up the document
          - We can only fax the document to the fax the provider gives us, not one that the member gives us
