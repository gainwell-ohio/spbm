**Ohio Medicaid 101** 

Ohio Medicaid provides health care coverage to over 3 million members in Ohio.  

There are over 130,000 active providers. 

ODM has created a Unified Preferred Drug List (UPDL) to ensure quality patient care while maintaining a financially responsible program.  The UPDL information on the SPBM Web Portal contains: 
- Unified Preferred Drug List 
- Unified Preferred Drug List Criteria 
- Preferred Diabetic Supply List 
- Specialty Drug List 
- Additional Therapeutic Classes w/Clinical Criteria 
- OTC list 
- Quantity Limits List (also contains maintenance drugs) 

**Medicaid Managed Care** 

Managed Care provides for delivering Medicaid health benefits and additional services through contracted arrangements between the state of Ohio and Managed Care Entities (MCEs) that accept a set per member per month (capitation) payment for these services.

By contracting with various MCEs to deliver Medicaid healthcare services to their beneficiaries, states can reduce Medicaid program costs and better manage health services.  

Improvement in health plan performance, health care quality, and outcomes are critical objectives of Medicaid Managed Care.  

**Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)** 

MCOs contract with a separate pharmacy benefit manager (PBM).  The PBM’s role is to improve the management and administration of pharmacy benefits for managed care recipients.    

As you know as of October 2022, Gainwell Technologies became the Single Pharmacy Benefit Manager (SPBM) for the Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM) pharmacy program for the managed care population.   

Fee for Service (FFS) member population will move to Gainwell in July 2023. 

**There are 9 Ohio Medicaid Pharmacy Plans** 

FFS (Fee for Service) – PBA is Change Healthcare until July 2023 

A member CANNOT have a managed care plan and FFS at the same time. 

A member CAN have a managed care plan and OhioRISE at the same time.

All Prescribers and Pharmacies must be registered with the Ohio Department of Medicaid. 

Claims written by prescribers not registered with ODM will be rejected.  Gainwell is not permitted to accept prior authorizations from prescribers that are not registered with ODM. 

Pharmacies submitting claims for Ohio Medicaid Managed Care members must be “in network” with Gainwell or the claims will be rejected, however pharmacies submitting claims for Fee for Service members do not have to be in network with Gainwell and will NOT be rejected. 

**COST AVOIDANCE** 

Medicaid is usually the payer of last resort.  The ONLY exception is when a member has BCMH (Bureau for Children with Medical Handicaps) 

Gainwell is contractually obligated to ensure that all other possible payers are billed before the member’s Ohio Medicaid plan is billed.  If the member has any other insurance provider (also referred to as a third-party liability or TPL). 

**FEE FOR SERVICE (FFS)** 

Fee-for-Service pharmacy claims are processed by ODM’s contracted pharmacy benefits administrator (PBA) Change Healthcare.    
- BIN- 015863 
- PCN- OHPOP 
- GROUP -NONE 

Fee for Service (FFS) Help Desk (obsolete as of July 1, 2023) 

[Insert Table]

Change Healthcare who is the PBA for Ohio Medicaid’s Fee for Service account is NOT the same as ODJFS (Ohio Department of Job and Family Services).    

Change Healthcare (FFS) is NOT able to update eligibility, nor can they remove TPL. 

If you believe a member has FFS (instead of a managed care plan), please ask the pharmacy to bill FFS using the BIN/PCN above.   

**You are to only WARM transfer to FFS once the pharmacy has billed the FFS BIN/PCN and the claim rejects for something other than “Bill Managed Care Plan”.**
