## Medicare

It is very important that you understand Medicare.  Medicare plans MUST be billed before Medicaid plans. If claims are submitted without the pharmacy billing the member’s Medicare plan will be rejected.  Medicare rejections should **NOT** be overridden.   

**If you feel a members Medicare eligibility is not correct in VUE360RX, please send an email to SPBMEligibility@gainwelltechnologies.com for verification** 

**Medicare Part A**, also known as “traditional Medicare,” provides inpatient/hospital coverage. This is for inpatient care in a hospital or other covered care facility. 

**Medicare Part B**, also traditional Medicare, provides outpatient/medical coverage. This is the physician, nurse practitioner, and other advanced practice licensed professionals.  Medicare Part B also covers some prescription medications.  

**Medicare Part C**, or Medicare Advantage (MA), is a health insurance option available to Medicare beneficiaries. Private, Medicare-approved insurance companies run Medicare Advantage programs. These companies arrange for or directly provide healthcare. 

**Medicare Part D**, the Prescription Drug Benefit, provides prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part A and/or Part B who enroll in a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) or an MA Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plan. 

If a member has Medicare Part A & Part B, they are **required** to obtain a Part D plan.  These members may not show a Part D plan in their eligibility profile, however claims will still reject to bill Medicare Part D. You should **NOT** override these claims.  Please advise the members to call 1-800 MEDICARE or contact their county caseworker at ODJFS for assistance.
