# Third Party Callers

## Identifying a Third-Party Caller

**What is Third Party?** 

A third party is an individual or entity that is involved in the facilitation of a transaction but is neither one of the primary parties.  
- First party- Gainwell Technologies Pharmacy services. 
- Second Party- Contacted Pharmacies, Prescribers, MCE and Members.  

Third-party caller will use a soliciting call tactic. By presenting participle information to seek something desired by indirectly prompting someone to offer it. 

A third party might not always identify themselves on a call.  

Technicians will need to listen for clues such as:

- “This is caller name, from Cover my meds” 
- “I am calling on behalf of” 
- “This call may be recorded” 
- “We do not have an NPI number. I can give you the doctor’s NPI number.” 
- Listen for background noise, seeming like a call center. 
- Could have out of state phone number 

Gainwell Technologies does not have contracts to talk to third-parties, technicians will need to let the caller know that we are unable to give them any information. 

Case Mangers, that work for the MCE and ODJFS (Ohio Department of Job and Family Services), are not considered third party and information may be given to them. 

**Since you are not permitted to provide PHI to Third Party Callers, you may not be able to log a call note for these calls.  If you are uncertain if you are talking to a Third-Party Caller, please reach out to your Sr. Technician or Supervisor**
