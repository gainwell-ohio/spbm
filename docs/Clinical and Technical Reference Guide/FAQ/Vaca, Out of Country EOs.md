| **As of 1/10/23, effective immediately** | ODM changed the vacation override policy yesterday afternoon. It is as follows: <ul><li>All drugs: 3 months maximum override</li><li>1 override per medication per year</li><ul><li>**No exceptions allowed**</li></ul><li>If travel is in the USA, consideration should be made for in network pharmacies available to fill BEFORE providing overrides</li><li>Must document: Leaving date, return date, travel location (city, state, country).</li><li>Confirm ALL maintenance medications needed during the call (document the names of the medications, if they are only asking for 1 medication but there are more, ask about the additional drugs, **it is not acceptable to say that they only asked for 1 drug - you need to ask**)</li><li>Consider the quantity available/left on the prescription</li></ul> |
| | <ul><li>**No more emailing ODM for approval.**</li><li>**Technicians can approve these overrides themselves.**</li></ul>
