# Claims Dispute Process

## Pharmacy Claims Dispute

If we receive a call from a pharmacy requesting to dispute reimbursement, then please follow this process.

Please inform the caller that the best and most efficient way to do this is to fill out the Claim Dispute form found on our website:

[Claim Dispute Form](https://spbm.medicaid.ohio.gov/SPDocumentLibrary/DocumentLibrary/Forms/Pharmacy%20Claim%20Reimbursement%20Dispute%20Form.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

If the pharmacy refuses to go to the website, then you must get this information:

- NPI for pharmacy
- Dates of Service or Rx Number
- Drug name
- Description of issue

  Once you gather this information send an email to IT Service Desk <a href="mailto:odm@service-now.com">odm@service-now.com</a> and instruct them to assign the ticket to Kristen Baldock.

If they are asking general questions about reimbursement, then direct them to the Pharmacy Reference Guides found here:
