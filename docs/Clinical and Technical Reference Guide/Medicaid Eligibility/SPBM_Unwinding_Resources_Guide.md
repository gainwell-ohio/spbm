The Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM) eligibility team issued [Medicaid Eligibility Procedure Letter (MEPL) #172](https://medicaid.ohio.gov/static/About+Us/PoliciesGuidelines/MEPL/MEPL-172.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on February 28, 2023, advising the County Departments of Job and Family Services (CDJFSs) that eligibility discontinuances, which were paused during the public health emergency, would resume April 1, 2023. Normally, Medicaid eligibility is redetermined every twelve months. The redetermination process involves an attestation under penalty of perjury and verification that members meet nonfinancial, financial, and – in some cases – resource criteria for Medicaid.
