Federal statute prohibits Medicaid payment for services to inmates of a public institution including 
prisons, jails, and detention centers.

There is one exception to this rule - Medicaid can and does cover Medicaid eligible incarcerated individuals
for hospital inpatient services greater than 24 hours.

**Medicaid cannot cover prescriptions for incarcerated individuals.**
