Important!
We are seeing Denied PAs for generic Ciprodex (Ciprofloxacin/Dexamethasone) - Please refer to the information posted on 11/06/2023. ==Ciprodex has been discontinued by the manufacturer==. [Monday 11/6/23 1:11 PM] Collingwood, Justin
Important!
Everyone Effective immediately, for pharmacies that self-attest they cannot secure stock of the preferred brand product, ODM is approving PA-overrides to allow the respective generics, Fluticasone or Ciprofloxacin/Dexamethasone, to be covered. If we follow our evergreen directions on shortages we can approve for 90 days, in which they will be addressing at the January P&T meeting, which will cover then. Please approve these generics for Flovent or Ciprodex if we hear any request for them either in tech chat or in med review
