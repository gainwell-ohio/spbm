Hi Matt â€“
ODM has asked CHC to make the necessary config chgs on both Flovent and Ciprodex to move their generics to preferred (and remove BvG flag).  However, due to the short holiday week, they cannot make these config chgs until Fri 12/1/23.

Please continue the edit override process in the meantime.

Thank you,
Scott



### As of 11/6/2023:

If a pharmacy calls in and states that they have a shortage of **Flovent** or **Ciprodex**, the agent can enter a PA override for the respective generics (^^Fluticasone^^ or ^^Ciprofloxacin/Dexamethasone^^), to be covered.

Important!
We are seeing Denied PAs for generic Ciprodex (Ciprofloxacin/Dexamethasone) - Please refer to the information posted on 11/06/2023. ==Ciprodex has been discontinued by the manufacturer==. [Monday 11/6/23 1:11 PM] Collingwood, Justin
Important!
Everyone Effective immediately, for pharmacies that self-attest they cannot secure stock of the preferred brand product, ODM is approving PA-overrides to allow the respective generics, Fluticasone or Ciprofloxacin/Dexamethasone, to be covered. If we follow our evergreen directions on shortages we can approve for 90 days, in which they will be addressing at the January P&T meeting, which will cover then. Please approve these generics for Flovent or Ciprodex if we hear any request for them either in tech chat or in med review
