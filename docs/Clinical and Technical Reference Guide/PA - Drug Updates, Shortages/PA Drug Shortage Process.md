**General rule for shortage issues (per Justin Collingwood):** 

**02/23/23** 
- If it is a **known** shortage (Check the AHSP website) and if listed:  
  - Have the pharmacy process for a DAW 4 or 8 
  - If still having a rejection, place an EO or PA for the time stated of shortage, up to 3 months 
    - Please document in the EO that this is being approved due to the generic shortage. 

 **02/23/23** 
- If there is an **unknown** shortage, (still check AHSP website):
  - **If a PA is the notifying communication, it is stated that there is a shortage, this must be stated, and we are to take their word from it, and approve for 3 months.**
  - If a pharmacy calling, attempt to process a DAW 4 or 8 when possible. 
  - If the pharmacy is stating there is a shortage, they must send a screen shot of their invoices stating shortage or of their distributor (Cardinal, Anda) showing a shortage to OHSupervisorsandSr.Techs@mygainwell.onmicrosoft.com or Alorica_OHSPBM@mygainwell.onmicrosoft.com 
    - These emails are to be able to be accessed by a technician to acquire the correct shortage information and craft either an override or PA, whatever is necessary to process, for 3 months. 
    - The documents of the invoices need to be able to be sent in when pharmacies are open, and attached to a PA or EO as required, verified and approved so members can get their medication.
