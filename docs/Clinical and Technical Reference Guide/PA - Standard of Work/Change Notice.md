For auditing purposes it is extremely important that we properly and thoroughly document our PA decisions. The QA team will be looking to see that these are filled out completely and correctly when conducting evaluations. |
| 02/23/23 | NEW PA trackers released - to be used beginning 03/01/23. | Trackers are now split by priority of focus. This has been done to split the data and reduce lag. See Links and IT Help for the latest Monthly PA Tracker links. |
