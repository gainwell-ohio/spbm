| 8/10/2023 | Criteria to cancel for duplicate PA | Per ODM direction, moving forward, we are NOT to cancel a case as a duplicate request for a member unless it comes in on the same date with the same information. Ex: If we receive a case on 8/8 (we denied) and then again on 8/9 with the same information, we are to review and then deny (not send back as a cancellation). Ex: If we receive a case on 8/8 (we denied) and then another case on 8/8 comes in with the same exact information, we can cancel with fax back. |
