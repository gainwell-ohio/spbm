# Duplicate PAs and Subsequent Authorizations

## Duplicate PAs and Subsequent Authorization Notes
- Techs can review Auto Med Review cases
- Legacy PAs can be used when determining if a PA is a Subsequent Authorization / Continuation of Therapy.
- If a dose or frequency change goes over quantity limits, ensure you are basing your decision off of that criteria also
