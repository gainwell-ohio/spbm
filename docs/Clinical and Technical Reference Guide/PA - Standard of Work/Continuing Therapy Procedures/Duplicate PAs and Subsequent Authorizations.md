# Duplicate PAs and Subsequent Authorizations

## Duplicate PAs

- A Duplicate PA is a PA that was recieved on the same date with the same requested drug, same dose & frequency as another PA
  - **General Notes:**
    - If the Loading Dose and Maintenance Dose are on separate PAs , each person should decision them separatly and document the auth of the other PA in your note
    - If a duplicate PA is not allocated to anyone, reach out to your leader so the PA can be allocated to you
    - If there are more than two duplciate PAs in the system, start the chat with everyone those PAs are allocated to
      
## Subsequent Authorizations

- A Subsequent Authorization (Renewal) is a PA that was receieved when a PA is already on file that has expired or will expire within 30 days
- **General Notes:**
  - Techs can review Auto Med Review cases
  - Legacy PAs can be used when determining if a PA is a Subsequent Authorization / Continuation of Therapy.
  - If a dose or frequency change goes over quantity limits, ensure you are basing your decision off of that criteria also
