# Formworks

FormWorks (FIS): This is the OCR (optical character recognition) system that our faxes will come into before they go into Vue360rx. There will be data correction queues where some of our staff will have to validate characters that the system cannot read so that PA request can be autogenerated in Vue360rx.
