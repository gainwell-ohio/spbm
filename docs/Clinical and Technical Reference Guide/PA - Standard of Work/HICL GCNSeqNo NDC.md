# When to select drug by HICL, GCNseqNo and NDC

## General Notes

- When working on prior authorizations, select the GCNseqNO if moving from fax view to pending or from pending to medreview. 
- **If you are to be the final decider [approve/cancel/ (deny - RPh only)], follow the HICL-GCN-NDC guidance when selecting the drug name**


### From most general to strict, it goes HICL-GCN-NDC

**HICLseqNO:**

- Use when there is going to be multiple strengths or vials used in a period
- This allows the freedom to use these vials and relies on quantity in the PA to control the amount dispensed.

**GCNseqNO:**

- What most of our approvals or denials should be.
- Allows all NDCS within a certain drug strength to pay
   - Allows all brands to pay 

**NDC:**

- Use when a specific NDC is needed to be approved or denied
- Brand vs Generic Drugs (perferred Brands)
- DAW 1 when a certain NDC is requested
- When a certain drug labeler is being approved (example  Epipen)
