If a technician is moving a PA through the ques, please use GCNseqNO, if you are to be the final decider, be it technician or pharmacist, you must adjust at what level you are to decide.
This makes it easier on the techs that are moving things through to be uniform, and those specialized enough to approve or deny to apply.

From most general to strict, it goes HICL-GCN-NDC.

-HICLseqNO:
We want to use when there is going to be multiple strengths or vials used in a period, like different vials of a factor, the 56 and 84 doses of Spravato that can be changed based on last 
appointment, or an initial and continuing dosage of Humira for 90 days initial PA.This allows the freedom to use these vials and relies on quantity in the PA to control the amount dispensed.

-GCNseqNO:
What most of our approvals or denials should be. This is generally in place for multiple generic use at the pharmacy level, meaning if we approve a non-preferred medication, it doesn’t matter who
makes it (Teva, Mylan) the pharmacy can dispense it. This is why if you approve at NDC level the pharmacy will call back and need it fixed at their next shipment time when they get a different
manufacturer. If able, do not approve at NDC level.

-NDC:
This is when a specific NDC is needed to be approved or denied, as in the cases of DAW1, they only want the brand. For BvG we must and pharmacy must process for the preferred brand name with DAW 9,
meaning the plan prefers the medication. For diabetic testing supplies, all the test strips have the same GCNseqNO, and must be specified at the NDC level when doing PAs.

Again, when moving from fax/pending or anywhere else in Vue360rx, please use GCNseqNO, and if approving please use the guidance for the appropriate times. If you have questions in specificity
for processing/approving/denying(pharmacists), please contact your leads.
