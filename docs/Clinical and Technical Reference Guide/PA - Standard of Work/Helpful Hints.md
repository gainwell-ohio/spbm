# Helpful Hints

| Look up Claims of Requested Drug and Claims of Trials with ease: | When looking at claims and trials, use PROFILE next to DOCS. Change the date range back 1 year. "LEFT" click on the drug name to alphabetize the list and put them in descending order of most recent claims. The qty and day supply are visible without opening the claim, making documentation faster.
| Eliminate VUE360RX Timeout | Have one VUE360RX tab open in a regular browser and use an incognito browser to check eligibility, claims history, drug coverage, etc. If more than 1 tab of VUE360RX is open in the same browser it will time out and lose your PA progress.
| Age Restriction not clear in UPDL: | The age restriction for medications is often found on the Daily Med website: [DailyMed (nih.gov)](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/index.cfm){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
| More information is received for a PA: (labs, notes, etc) | If the PA is in pending, add the updated / new information to the notes section. If the PA is no longer pending, a new PA will need to be created. |
