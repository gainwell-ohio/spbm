# PA Documentation Notes
Your notes should be so clear that the person looking at your notes knows your exact thought process

## The Criteria and correct PA templates need to be included in your notes
- **Notes should include each point of the Criteria**
    - If that point of the Criteria is met, include page number you found that information, claims history, ect.
    - If that point of the Criteria is not met, what led you to that conclusion?
       - **Example Documentation**
          - If one point of the Criteria states :"TB Test Required":
              - *"TB Test confirmed, pg 3 of chart notes"*.
- You should NEVER just write "criteria met" or "Auto Med Review".
- If age restriction or Quality limit is apart of the Criteria, those need to be included

## When documenting applicable drug trials include:
| | | 
| :--- | :--- |
| **Drug Strength** | | 
|  **Quantity Dispensed** | | 
|  **The Dates of Service** | If trials occurred over continuous span, OK to document like 5/30/2022- 12/30/2023.| 
| ***If Documenting Trials from the PA Form*** | Include if the Trials are verified by Vue360RX Claims and if not, why | 
    
## How to document Vue360RX Claims and any Drug Trials included on the PA Form:
- **If Approving the PA**
    - Only have to include enough claims history / trials to fulfill the Criteria.
      - Example Documentation
          - *Approved per paid claims and trials on PA form member meets criteria of trialing 3 preferred medications for at least 180 days each. Member trialed the following 3 preferred drugs: DRUG A 30MG 1tab per day 1/1/2020 - 4/1/2020, Drug B 45MG 1tab per day 4/1/2020 - 8/1/2020, Drug C 60MG 1tab per day 8/1/2020 - 12/1/2020.*
- **If Sending PA to Med Review**
    - Document all claims of Preferred and Non-Preferred drugs in that Class
    - Document all drug trials listed on the PA form, regardless if Preferred or Non-Preferred
      - Example Documentation
         - *Sent to Med Review per member does not meet the criteria of trialing 3 preferred medications for at least 90 days each. Per claims history, member trialed the following 2 preferred drugs: DRUG A 30MG 1tab per day 1/1/2020 - 4/1/2020, Drug B 45MG 1tab per day 4/1/2020 - 8/1/2020.
