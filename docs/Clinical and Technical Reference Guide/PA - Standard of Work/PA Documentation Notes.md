# PA Documentation Notes

The Tech Templates will be used when working PA's in Vue360rx to organize a format so all info needed will be on every case worked by any tech. 

## PA Documentation Reminders

**We are noticing that PA notes can be lacking very important information.** 

- Your notes should be so clear that the person looking at your notes knows your exact thought process
  -  More information is better.
  - Pro Tip: Paste applicable criteria in your notes and go one by one, reporting if that point of the criteria was met or not and how you got that information.

**When approving a PA or sending to Med Review, make sure to include ALL pertinent information including each point on the criteria you are using.**

 -  Techs need to list out the criteria including each criteria point and if the member meets or does not meet in all PA notes. 
    -  When documenting applicable drug trails include the drug strength, quality dispensed, and the dates of service for each medication. If trials occurred over continuous span, OK to document like 5/30/2022- 12/30/2023.
    -  You should NEVER just write "criteria met".
        -  If the member met that point of the criteria, include page number you found that information, claim history, ect.
        -  If the member does not meet that criteria point - what led you to that conclusion? Is the information not documented or did you see that the member tried one preferred drug and not 2 preferred drugs?
-  All lines of the Med Review template need to be filled out and if not applicable, an N/A or none needs to be included.
    -  **Techs should never just put "auto med review". Even for Auto Med Review Medications need to have all points of the criteria written down in your notes for the RPH.**
-  If age restriction or Quality limit is apart of the criteria, those need to be included also.

**PA Claims Lookback Period Update**

- We only need to document enough claims data to fulfill the criteria. We can go as far back as Vue360RX allows to get this information. However, once the criteria is met, no other claims information is needed.

## Example Notes
- If one point of the criteria states :"TB Test Required" you should add to your notes something like:
  - *"TB Test confirmed, pg 3 of chart notes"*.
- Criteria is "needs trials of at least 180 days for 3 preferred medications"
    -  Only have to include enough claims to meet that. If the member has tried 4 preferred medications for 1 years each, we do not have to include all of those.
    -  Examples 
        - *Approved per paid claims data member meets criteria of trialing 3 preferred medications for at least 180 days each. Member trialed the following 3 preferred drugs: DRUG A 30MG 1tab per day 1/1/2020 - 4/1/2020, Drug B 45MG 1tab per day 4/1/2020 - 8/1/2020, Drug C 60MG 1tab per day 8/1/2020 - 12/1/2020.*
        - *Sent to Med Review per paid claims data member does not meet criteria of trialing 3 preferred medications for at least 180 days each. Member trialed the following 2 preferred drugs: DRUG A 30MG 1tab per day 1/1/2020 - 4/1/2020, Drug B 45MG 1tab per day 4/1/2020 - 8/1/2020.*
        - *Sent to Med Review per paid claims data member does not meet criteria of trialing 3 preferred medications for at least 180 days each. Member trialed the following 2 preferred drugs: DRUG A 30MG 1tab per day 1/1/2020 - 4/1/2020, Drug B 45MG 1tab per day 4/1/2020 - 8/1/2020. However, trialed Drug D 45MG 1tab per day 1/1/2021 - 4/1/2023. Drug D is not a preferred drug but can be used for the DX.*
