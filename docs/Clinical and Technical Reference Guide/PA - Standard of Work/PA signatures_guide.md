## PA Signatures

**Accept all signatures regardless of a printed name being present or attestation box being "checked" unless:**
- There is no signature
    - If there is no signature, fax back and report missing signature
 
- The signature is obviously from an Pharmacist at the dispensing Pharmacy
    - Pharmacists CAN prescribe in Ohio and CAN submit Prior Authorizations. Only reject if it is obviously from a dispensing pharmacy, example: CVS
