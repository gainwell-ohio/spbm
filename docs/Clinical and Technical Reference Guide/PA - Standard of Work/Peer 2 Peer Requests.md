# Peer to Peer (P2P) requests

Please ensure that we are:

1.	If a peer to peer request is needed with a pharmacist, it is the responsibility of the pharmacist who decisioned the PA to take the peer to peer call (whether it be immediately, or a call back). If the pharmacist who decisioned the case is not available (OOO, at lunch, etc.), it is the responsibility of the pharmacist in the chat to take the peer to peer. We should **ALWAYS** be performing the peer to peer when it is **convenient for the prescriber/provider** and not at our convenience (whether this be immediately or a call back – whichever the prescriber/provider prefers). Pharmacists are then to document the peer to peer interaction on the internal tracker.
   
2.	A technician should **NEVER** refuse to allow the provider to perform a peer to peer. It is on the denial letter for every provider that they have the right to perform a peer to peer. We have been told that technicians are advising that we are “cracking down” on the amount of peer to peers we are allowing – this is NOT the case! 

Most of the time, the provider is wanting to provide additional information to support the PA request via peer to peer (they are not just calling to complain). This takes time for the provider to do. As pharmacists taking the peer to peer, it is our responsibility to actively listen to any additional information that is provided and make a determination based off of this additional information.
