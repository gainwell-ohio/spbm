## Faxing a Reject Fax Process

[Faxing a Reject Fax to Cancel a PA in the PA Queue](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/kaelyn_dobbins_gainwelltechnologies_com/EdecAOUIQB9FrG4x_QsjAAgBjXos8-nsfhqsSG9i83JqEQ?e=9iwXbj){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

When working from the PA Queue, you may come across PA’s that need to be cancelled for the following reasons:

- Member not eligible/Member has FFS
-	Not a Pharmacy Benefit/Needs to go through Medical
-	Duplicate PA on file

In these cases, you will need to use the “Reject Fax” and complete the form by using the “Reject Fax Templates” located in the “Ohio Pharmacy Call Centers Notebook” in OneNote. 

Before sending your fax, please copy you Reject Fax Template documentation from the fax and paste into your Notes section on the PA and state that a fax was sent. Then change the status to cancel and hit Submit.

Once you have prepared the Reject Fax with proper documentation, you should save the document to your One Drive. Now you can send the fax using Open Text. [https://myportal.opentext.com/XddsPortal/](https://myportal.opentext.com/XddsPortal/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
