# Cancel and Not Required Checklist

## Items to consider prior to canceling:
 1.	Does the signature follow the guidance provided on Evergreen?
    
 2.	Is the ICD-10 code provided? If not, is the diagnosis code provided on the PA form or within the chart notes? If yes, please use the search function on the PA screen to choose the most appropriate diagnosis code.
       
 3.	Is the request for a BvG medication? Always check the rejected claims to see what the pharmacy is submitting for.
       
 4.	Duplicate requests
      a. -	A duplicate request is only considered a duplicate if the request is for the exact same medication, dose, frequency as a request previously submitted and approved on the same day. If the request comes through on a different day (example – the next day), this is to be reviewed as a new request, and not a duplicate.

     - Internal template used for cancelled cases should include at minimum: Reason for cancellation, job # within OpenText, fax # cancelled fax was sent to, date and time that cancelled fax was successfully sent via OpenText. In addition, the outbound fax communication MUST be uploaded through Process Manager and attached to the cancelled PA.
   
## Items to consider prior to sending back as “PA Not Required”:

1.	Have you checked the rejected claim to see why the provider is submitting a PA? Does the medication truly need a PA or just an edit override?

2.	Have you verified that the request is not for a BvG medication?

3.	Have you verified that the request does not exceed any quantity limits or age restrictions per the UPDL?
