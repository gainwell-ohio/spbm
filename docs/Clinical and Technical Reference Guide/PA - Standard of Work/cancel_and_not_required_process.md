### Faxing a Reject Fax Process

[Faxing a Reject Fax to Cancel a PA in the PA Queue](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/kaelyn_dobbins_gainwelltechnologies_com/EdecAOUIQB9FrG4x_QsjAAgBjXos8-nsfhqsSG9i83JqEQ?e=9iwXbj){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

When working from the PA Queue, you may come across PA’s that need to be cancelled for the following reasons:

- Member not eligible/Member has FFS
-	Not a Pharmacy Benefit/Needs to go through Medical
-	Duplicate PA on file

In these cases, you will need to use the “Reject Fax” and complete the form by using the “Reject Fax Templates” located in the “Ohio Pharmacy Call Centers Notebook” in OneNote. 

Before sending your fax, please copy you Reject Fax Template documentation from the fax and paste into your Notes section on the PA and state that a fax was sent. Then change the status to cancel and hit Submit.

Once you have prepared the Reject Fax with proper documentation, you should save the document to your One Drive. Now you can send the fax using Open Text. [https://myportal.opentext.com/XddsPortal/](https://myportal.opentext.com/XddsPortal/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

## Items to consider prior to canceling:
 1.	Does the signature follow the guidance provided on Evergreen?
    
 2.	Is the ICD-10 code provided? If not, is the diagnosis code provided on the PA form or within the chart notes? If yes, please use the search function on the PA screen to choose the most appropriate diagnosis code.
       
 3.	Is the request for a BvG medication? Always check the rejected claims to see what the pharmacy is submitting for.
     
 4.	Duplicate requests
      a. -	A duplicate request is only considered a duplicate if the request is for the exact same medication, dose, frequency as a request previously submitted and approved on the same day. If the request comes through on a different day (example – the next day), this is to be reviewed as a new request, and not a duplicate.

     - Internal template used for cancelled cases should include at minimum: Reason for cancellation, job # within OpenText, fax # cancelled fax was sent to, date and time that cancelled fax was successfully sent via OpenText. In addition, the outbound fax communication MUST be uploaded through Process Manager and attached to the cancelled PA.
   
## Items to consider prior to sending back as “PA Not Required”:

1.	Have you checked the rejected claim to see why the provider is submitting a PA? Does the medication truly need a PA or just an edit override?

2.	Have you verified that the request is not for a BvG medication?

3.	Have you verified that the request does not exceed any quantity limits or age restrictions per the UPDL?
