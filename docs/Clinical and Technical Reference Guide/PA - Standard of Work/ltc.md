# LTC

When we have a request for RTS due to either an admit or discharge from LTC you will enter the EO. 

There are a couple things to note here:

-	7289 reject means there was a previous fill that was denying for 7073 that was overridden and the current fill falls within that date span(ex. Filling on day 25 when previous early fill was for 30 days.) Please make sure you fill the full quantity or else the next fill will conflict with the one we had to override.
-	We do still override the 7289 if they werenâ€™t notified to fill the full qty for one reason or another.
-	If the request is for a higher dosage that is not covered in the UPDL then we will need a new Prior Authorization.
