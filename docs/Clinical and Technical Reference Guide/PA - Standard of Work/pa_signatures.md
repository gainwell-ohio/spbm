# PA Signatures

NEVER cancel a PA for a missing signature

### Accept "signature" if the PA has atleast ONE of the following three elements:

- Signature
     - any marking on the line is acceptable, including typed signatures
- Printed Name
- Attestation box Marked 
     

### Techs send the following PAs to "Med Review", using appropriate template and notes  

- The PA has ZERO of the above three elements
- The signature is obviously from a Pharmacist at the dispensing Pharmacy
    - Pharmacists CAN prescribe in Ohio and CAN submit Prior Authorizations. Only reject if it is obviously from a dispensing pharmacy, example: CVS
