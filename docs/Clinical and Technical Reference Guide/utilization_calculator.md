# Utilization Calculator

## [Tool Calculator](<Utilization Calculator.xlsx>){ :target=_blank rel="noopener" }

The Utilization Calculator Tool is designed to assist in determining if utilization has been met
with a recent dosage change. The highlighted and starred sections are what is important to
determine utilization, the remaining sections are additional information that is auto populated in 
case the caller has questions. Below are the steps to give a better understanding of each of the 
highlighted sections.

**Step 1**: ==*QTY Received==

Column 1 is ^^**quantity received**^^. This is the quantity of the **original** prescription filled at the pharmacy.

**Example: If the original fill was written as 60 tablets for 30 days, you will enter ^^60^^ in the quantity received section.** 

**Step 2**: ==*Utilization % (in decimal)==

Column 2 is ^^**utilization % in decimal**^^. This is the percentage of the medication that must be used for utilization to be met. For **non-controlled** medications, it must be **80% or 0.8** utilized. For **controlled** medications, it must be **90% or 0.9** utilized. 

**Example: If the medication is dispensed is Adderall, 90% utilization must be met. If the medication dispensed is Duloxetine, 80% utilization must be met.**

**Step 3**: ==*Day Supply Reeived==

Column 3 is ^^**day supply received**^^. This is the day supply of the **original** prescription filled at the pharmacy. 

**Example: If the ^^original^^ fill was written as 60 tablets for 30 days, you will enter ^^30^^ in the day supply received section.**

**Step 4**: ==*Date of last claim== 

Column 4 is ^^**date of last claim**^^. This section is referring to the date the **original claim** was filled at the pharmacy. 

**Example: If the last ^^paid^^ claim prior to the new claim was filled on 8/15/2024, this is the date that would be entered into this section.**

**Step 5**: ==*Date New DDU started==

Column 5 is ^^**date the new DDU started**^^. This is the day the member **started taking** the new dose prescribed by the provider. This is not always the date the new script was sent in, and it is important to clarify this date with the pharmacy to ensure we are calculating correctly.

**Example: the member began T the new dose on 8/16/2024 but the new script was sent to the pharmacy on 8/25/2024. The date of ^^8/16/2024^^ will be entered into this section.**

**Step 6: ==*New DDU==

Column 6 is ^^**new DDU**^^. This is the **new** daily dose that is being billed for the dosage increase. 

**Example: The new script is being billed for 90 tablets for 30 days. The new DDU would be entered as ^^3^^. (DDU=quantity dispensed/day supply)**

**Step 7**: ==Soonest fill Date==

Column 7 is ^^**soonest fill date**^^. This is the final section of the utilization tool. This date is provided when steps 1-6 are completed accurately. Provide this to the pharmacy as the date utilization will be met and the medication can be filled.

**Example:**

1.	Quantity received - 60
2.	Utilization % (in decimal) - 0.8
3.	Day supply received – 30
4.	Date of last claim – 8/3/2024
5.	Date new DDU started – 8/15/2024
6.	New DDU – 4
7.	Soonest fill date – 8/21/2024
