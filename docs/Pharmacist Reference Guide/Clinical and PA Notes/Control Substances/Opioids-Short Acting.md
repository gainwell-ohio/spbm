# Opioids- Short Acting

[Opioids- Short Acting Email](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/Short%20Acting%20Opioid%20information.msg?csf=1&web=1&e=DtTdeD)

Hello,

After seeing the quantity limit edit turned on last week and most of the requests in tech chat consult, it has been decided that more direction is required in the processing of prior authorization and edit overrides being requested for short acting opioids.
This has been created with all of the edits firing appropriately in mind such as quantity limits and prior authorization required for future preparedness.
 
As always, in general practice please refer to all our resources like the UPDL and quantity limits sheet, they can help answer many of the questions that arise in situations.
 
From the UPDL - 

***Effective July 1, 2018, patients with short acting opioid therapy will be limited to 30 MED per prescription and a maximum of 7 days per prescription. Prior authorization will be required to exceed these limits***
 
This means any pharmacy or provider or member call questioning any situation that is beyond the statement above, requires a PA
 
This has been the situation with opioids for years, I have personally experienced it when it was implemented and through the application of it. The pharmacies are warned when PAs are required as soft warning as of now and prescribers have had to do PAs for opioids in the past. 
 
Misinformation must be stopped and whenever pharmacies/prescribers/members are interacted with via call/fax/email, we need to try to provide the most accurate and abundant information as possible. We should implement these practices into our daily processing immediately to prepare for when things are at steady state. Many of the tech consult questions regarding edits involving things like edits 7026 and 7376 can be researched and addressed without involving pharmacists in pharmacist consult chat. Last week was a surprise to us all with the overwhelming calls of quantity limit edits, but in opioid situations many things are defined as requiring a PA. Please do not indicate that PAs are not required when a days supply issue or quantity edit override is required. Please be mindful of when a PA is required with working with these medications, in the case of the UPDL, preferred medications do not always mean a PA is not required, especially in these instances. Any thing that is indicated requiring a PA, above quantity limit, not within established age limits, DAW requests, or anything else specifically stated in the UPDL, Additional Criteria, Quantity limits, or Med Nec policy needs to be handled with a PA and these information sources should be used to direct and guide all (pharmacies, precribers, members, Gainwell employees) in determining the appropriate course of action.
