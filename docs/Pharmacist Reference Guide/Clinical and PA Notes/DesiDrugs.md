# DESI Drugs

After further defining why there are green payable drugs in the NDC Maintenance tile from Tyler – 

DESI status occurs when a labeler has chosen not to seek the needed approvals for their drug. It’s often seen across all drugs in a GCN Seq No because newer drugs are automatically grandfathered into the DESI status of their drug/use case scenario.  Specifically with older drugs there will be one or two manufacturers that seek the required approvals on an older drug so that it’s payable under Medicaid plans. But because older drugs are not automatically updated, it causes some hit-or-miss scenarios across drugs.

The link above further explains the situation with desi drugs that were approved for safe use prior to 1962, and it would seem there wasn’t an incentive to go back and prove efficacious in some instances.
 
So it appears that some of them have sought the necessary requirements to be approvable, and that is why they are green in our system at this time. From my recollection I believe there is a drug file updated weekly(I could be wrong) but the take away point is that these may be updated regularly and a possibility may arise that it was payable last week and not payable this week, the best way to know at the time is to look in NDC maintenance tile.
 
I did get an example of a payable NDC not rejecting for DESI status in a typically DESI status GCNSeqNO, but did give the PA warning. So this means in time there will be PA requirements stopping these payable medications, at least in the one example I could come up with.
 
So as of now, If we get prior authorizations for what was once thought totally DESI, if there are green payable NDCs in that GCNSeqNO, I would not deny for admin denial DESI criteria, but process as a normal PA would be and strongly suggest if approving to include something like this in the APPROVAL LETTER Letter Text section:
 
**Please note that claims must be processed for a payable NDC to provide a successful claim submission**
 
There may be questions from pharmacies/providers about if a PA gets approved for this situation but I imagine they will need to use a payable NDC, which can be found in an NDC tile GCNSeqNO search. There maybe issues where if they are older approvals and NDCs used that pharmacies my not be able to acquire a payable one, but this is similar to any situation involving supply issues of payable medications.
