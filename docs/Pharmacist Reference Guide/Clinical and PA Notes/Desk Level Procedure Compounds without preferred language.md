# Overview

1.  Drug compounding is often regarded as the process of combining,
    mixing, or altering ingredients to create a medication tailored to
    the needs of an individual patient. Compounding includes the
    combining of two or more drugs. 

2.  Multi-ingredient Compound – a product containing two or more
    ingredients that is not FDA approved and is prepared upon the order
    of a prescriber for a patient.

3.  Compounded drugs are not FDA-approved. This means that FDA does not
    verify the safety or effectiveness of compounded drugs. Consumers
    and health professionals rely on the drug approval process for
    verification of safety, effectiveness, and quality. Compounded drugs
    also lack an FDA finding of manufacturing quality before such drugs
    are marketed. 
    
    1.  <https://www.fda.gov/>

4.  Compounds must be submitted using each national drug code (NDC) that
    is a part of the compound. Specific drug products and bulk
    ingredients utilized in compounds that are not covered will require
    prior authorization.

5.  If a prior authorization is not approved or if a component drug is
    not eligible for authorization (e.g., manufacturers not
    participating in the federal Medicaid rebate program), the pharmacy
    provider may elect to receive payment only for those items in the
    compound that are directly reimbursed by ODM. These rejected claims
    can be processed by:
    
    1.  Submitting the claim with the Submission Clarification Code
        (SCC) (NCPDP field \#42Ø-DK) of ‘08’. Note: SCC of 08 should not
        be utilized for claims that reject for reasons other than
        product coverage (such as refill too soon, duplicates, etc.) The
        use of SCC 08 will result in no reimbursement for the noncovered
        product.

6.  Payable active pharmaceutical compounding ingredients and excipients
    can be located at: https://spbm.medicaid.ohio.gov under “Reference
    Material”, then “Unified Preferred Drug List”. All compound claims
    should be submitted with a compound code (NCPDP field \#4Ø6-D6) = 2.

# Purpose

To provide guidance in the prior authorization review and decision
process for compound requests.

# Multi-Ingredient Compounds

Multi-ingredient compounds will be considered medically necessary when
all the following criteria are met:

1\. The active ingredients are prescribed in therapeutic amounts based
on FDA approved indications and

2\. If a compound is similar to a commercially available product but
differs in dosage, dosage form, or inert ingredient, chart notes are
required from the prescriber supporting the need for the

compound (i.e., documented difficulty or inability to swallow oral
dosage forms, documented

allergies to inactive ingredients) and

3\. If any ingredient in the compound, active or inactive, otherwise
requires prior authorization, the member must meet criteria established
for medical necessity for that ingredient and

4\. The member has tried and failed a 30-day trial with all preferred
medications that can be used to treat the member’s condition.

## Not Covered

Compounds will not be covered under the following circumstances or as
referenced in OAC 5160-9-03:

1\. The compound is being used for obesity, sexual dysfunction,
infertility, investigational or

experimental use or

2\. The compound is for a product that is commercially available or

3\. The compound is for convenience purposes only

### Not Medically Necessary

The following compounded preparations are not considered medically
necessary as they have not been proven to be more effective than
commercially available products:

1\. Compounded implantable hormone replacement pellets or granules (such
as: estrogen-based

implantable pellets)

2\. Bioidentical hormones

3\. Topical compounds containing baclofen, gabapentin, and ketamine

# Prior Authorization Form

The following PA Form must be submitted when requesting a compound.

# Process

##### Utilize the OHUPDL-Covered Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Excipients for Compounding when reviewing each ingredient for approval or denial

[20221209\_Payable\_Active\_Pharmaceutical\_Ingredients\_and\_Excipients\_for\_Compounding.pdf
(ohio.gov)](https://pharmacy.medicaid.ohio.gov/sites/default/files/20221209_Payable_Active_Pharmaceutical_Ingredients_and_Excipients_for_Compounding.pdf#overlay-context=drug-coverage)

  - Review Ingredients/Excipients on NDC Maintenance Tile in Vue360RX
    for preferred/nonpreferred/payable status

<!-- end list -->

1.  Compounds that are less than $100 do not require a PA for cost,
    
    1.  The compound may contain non-preferred products, each claim, PA
        request must be reviewed and decisioned appropriately. Utilize
        references available: Lexi, Medical Necessity Policy, OHUPDL and
        NDC Maintenance Tile in Vue360RX.

2.  All compounds that require a PA must be submitted on the Prior
    Authorization form for Compounds with all ingredients accounted for
    in the claim to be covered.

3.  Technicians will process compound PAs with the active ingredient as
    one prior authorization to be processed.

4.  All steps prior to researching the Compound PA must be completed
    (information verification).

5.  Additional information to be considered (Refer to Medical Necessity
    Policy)

  - **Multi-Ingredient Compounds**
    
    Multi-ingredient compounds will be considered medically necessary
    when all the following criteria are met:
    
    1.The active ingredients are prescribed in therapeutic amounts based
    on FDA approved indications and
    
    2\. If a compound is similar to a commercially available product but
    differs in dosage, dosage form, or inert ingredient, chart notes are
    required from the prescriber supporting the need for the compound
    (i.e., documented difficulty or inability to swallow oral dosage
    forms, documented allergies to inactive ingredients) and
    
    3\. If any ingredient in the compound, active or inactive, otherwise
    requires prior authorization, the member must meet criteria
    established for medical necessity for that ingredient and
    
    4\. The member has tried and failed a 30-day trial with all
    preferred medications that can be used to treat the member’s
    condition.

<!-- end list -->

  - > **Compounds will not be covered under the following circumstances
    > or as referenced in OAC 5160-9-03:**
    
    1\. The compound is being used for obesity, sexual dysfunction,
    infertility, investigational or experimental use or
    
    2\. The compound is for a product that is commercially available or
    
    3\. The compound is for convenience purposes only

<!-- end list -->

  - **The following compounded preparations are not considered medically
    necessary as they have not been proven to be more effective than
    commercially available products:**
    
    1\. Compounded implantable hormone replacement pellets or granules
    (i.e., estrogen-based implantable pellets)
    
    2\. Bioidentical hormones
    
    3\. Topical compounds containing baclofen, gabapentin, and ketamine

<!-- end list -->

6.  Cost consideration: Review ***Actual Ingredient Cost*** in the claim
    window:
    
    ![Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description
    automatically
    generated](docs/images/Desk%20Level%20Procedure%20Compounds%20without%20preferred%20language/media/image5.png)
    
    The following rejection appears if cost is over $100:
    
    ![](docs/images/Desk%20Level%20Procedure%20Compounds%20without%20preferred%20language/media/image6.png)
    
    This EO would need to be entered when approved.

7.  When approving each PA or EO, each must have a daily dose unit for
    the entire compound being processed to get a successful claim, not
    the individual ingredients themselves.
    
    For an example omeprazole capsules: Even though only using 60
    capsules to make the compound, the daily dose units of the
    omeprazole capsules in this case would need to be 600/30 to get 20
    for the daily dosage units.

8.  All edit overrides will need to be reviewed and addressed per claim
    rejections: such as: quantity, age, days’ supply

9.  If a compound would use a non-payable product (such as: bulk, base,
    dye, flavoring, or preservatives), a PA and EO should NOT be
    approved for this but a clarification code of “08” in drug
    information section to opt out of requesting a payment for a
    non-payable drug. This will allow the claim to process but not pay
    for the non-payable ingredients.
    
    For questions on a compounding formula, please use Compounding
    Formulas (nationwidechildrens.org), it has a list of common basic
    formulas that are frequently requested, as well as Medication Routes
    of Administration - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf (nih.gov). It is the
    burden of the prescriber to provide sufficient evidence that a
    medication fits all the guidance and criteria for compounded
    medications and ingredients.
