Hello,

The question was brought up about the vagueness of A1c in decisioning for diabetic medications, specifically the portion given on UPDL –

Where goal was not very clearly defined. 

It was discussed that a great number like 6 or 5 would probably indicate a goal with initiation of therapy, but this is probably not likely the most appropriate scenario, especially if starting out at a higher 10-12, no one drug will be able to go down that much on average.
Situations will arise with initiation and use of preferred medications and each individual case is different. ***Each member’s goal will more than likely be different with each medication and will need to be taken into consideration.***

When deciding on trials if they are lacking adherence per claims and their A1C has risen, per criteria given we are well within our scope to ask about adherence leading the issue. If there is a detrimental side effect or contraindication that is stopping the trial short like acquired kidney disease, extreme nausea/vomiting/diarhea, allergic reactions, the 120 days may have to be cut short and A1c goal not achieved because of this.
 
In renewals it is a way to access medication efficacy, as in if A1c goes up from time of approval a justification would need to be provided as to why and what adjustments are to be made.
 
If there are any questions, please ask, more to come from clinical meeting today
Thanks,
 
Justin Collingwood
