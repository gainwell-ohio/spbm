# Faxes with Multiple PAs

Hello,

There have been some faxes  that have been popping up from OCR with multiple PAs attached to them. Selina had one today with around 10 people.

Stacie has informed me that when this happens with multiple PAs on them please email the sr tech group email and unlock yourself from it and place in the inprocess que
Then the techs will be able to grab and process then how is needed.

Thanks,
 
Justin Collingwood
