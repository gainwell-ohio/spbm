# Dr Beisler on Gender Dysmorphia

[1:13 PM] Allen, Erin

I was asking Brian M and Janelle about appeals for under age 18. Brian suggested that I email Dr Beisler.  (I had a Lupron for a 15 yo.)  Here is his response:
 
The criteria for hormonal therapy is not quite as strict as the criteria for surgery. That said, it should be approved if they have:
 
1. Diagnosis of gender dysphoria as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)

2. If patient is 17 years of age or younger:
	a. pediatric endocrinologist or other clinician experienced in pubertal assessment has
	determined hormone treatment to be appropriate
 
Sending them all to appeal is fine, as at this point we really need better guidance from ODM on how they want these cases handled.
