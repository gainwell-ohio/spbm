**CLINICAL CRITERIA**
 
## Pediatric Approvals (under 18 years of age):

Initial Approvals - based on diagnoses below 

Reauthorization: 365 days - Must provide documentation that the patient’s health status has improved since last approval (i.e., height, weight gain, improved body composition)  
 
Patient must have ONE of the following diagnoses:  
 
1. **Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD)** – 180-day approval: 

      - Standard deviation of 2.0 or more below mean height for chronological age; AND 
      - Failure of any two stimuli test to raise the serum growth hormone level above 10 nanograms/milliliter 

2. **Growth Retardation of Chronic Kidney Disease** – 365-day approval: 

      - Standard deviation of 2.0 or more below mean height for chronological age; AND 
	- Irreversible renal insufficiency with a glomerular filtration rate less than 75 ml/min per 1.73m2 but pre-renal transplant 

3. **Genetic diagnosis** – 365-day approval: 
	
      - One of the following: (a) Krause-Kivlin Syndrome; (b) Turner Syndrome; (c) PraderWilli Syndrome; (d) Noonan Syndrome 

4. **Neurosecretory Growth Retardation** – 180-day approval 
	
      - Standard deviation of 2.0 or more below mean height for chronological age; AND 
	- Mixed or normal response to any two (2) stimuli test in raising serum growth hormone above 10 nanograms/milliliter. 

5. **Idiopathic Short Stature** – 180-day approval               
	
      - A standard deviation of 2.25 or more below mean height for chronological age; AND 
      - A mixed or normal response to any two stimuli tests in raising serum growth hormone above 10 nanograms/milliliter

6. **Small for Gestational Age (SGA)** – 365-day approval 

      - Documentation to support diagnosis defined as birth weight or length 2 or more standard deviations below the mean for gestational age AND 
	- Child fails to manifest catch up growth before 2 years of age, defined as height 2 or more standard deviations below the mean for age and gender. Review must include evaluation of growth curves from birth 
 
**AND ALL of the following:**

1. Must be treated and followed by a pediatric endocrinologist, pediatric nephrologist, clinical geneticist, endocrinologist, or gastroenterologist (as appropriate for diagnosis) 
2. Must provide documentation to justify criteria being met, including height, weight, bone age (children), date and results of most current x- ray, stimulus test results, IGF1 levels and a growth chart (children). 
3. The patient does not have any FDA labeled contraindication(s) to therapy with the requested agent (i.e., closed epiphyses, no expanding intracranial lesion or tumor diagnosed, etc) 
4. Not being used in combination with another somatropin agent 
 
## Adult Approvals (18 years of age or older): 

Initial Approvals: 180 days 

Reauthorization: 365 days – must provide documentation by endocrinologist that discontinuing agent would have a detrimental effect on body composition or other metabolic parameters.  
 
Patients must have ONE of the following diagnoses along with documentation of medical necessity from an endocrinologist: 

1. ***Childhood Onset*** - Patients who were growth hormone deficient during childhood and who have a continued deficiency which is confirmed by provocative testing. 
2. ***Adult Onset*** – Patients who have growth hormone deficiency, either alone or with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, such as hypopituitarism, as a result of pituitary disease, surgery, hypothalamic disease, radiation therapy, or trauma. 
 
**AND ALL of the following:** 

1. Biochemical diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency by means of a negative response to an appropriate stimulation test ordered by the endocrinologist 

(Clonidine test is not acceptable for adults.) 

2. Base-line evaluation of the following clinical indicators: (1) insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1); (2) fasting lipid profile; (3) BUN; (4) fasting glucose; (5) electrolyte levels; (6) evaluation of any new osteoarthritis and joint pain; (7) bone density test  
3. The patient does not have any FDA labeled contraindication(s) to therapy with the requested agent (i.e., closed epiphyses, no expanding intracranial lesion or tumor diagnosed, etc)  
4. Other hormonal deficiencies addressed with adequate replacement therapy
