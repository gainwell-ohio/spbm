# Processing Factor PAs

[HICLSeqNo Approval Info  Email :material-email:](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/HclSeqNo%20Approval%20information.msg?csf=1&web=1&e=mjAgIk){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

There is an identified issue with approving things by Hicl, that the medication does not show up.  Please either at this time approve by GCNSeqNo whenever possible. If Hicl anything is the only route option, the name of the drug requested must be put in the approval notes for the people who receive the letter will know that this is the medication that is being approved or denied. 
 
At this time as well, if we receive a Factor PA, please enter the PAâ€™s for the totally quantity needed per month at maintenance and we will use edit overrides to allow the prn doses when required. 



When using HICL- please put the name of the medication in the Letter TEXT 

Letter Text: sample
***APPROVED MEDICATION: ELOCTATE***


***Potential issues using monthly dosing:***

Reject at pharmacy regarding PA qty mismatch - cannot be overridden at the moment- so member and pharmacy cannot bill for PRN dosing.  NEED A WORK AROUND. 
1. making 7215 overrideable for FACTOR PAs - fast solution with very little system change
2. we need to change the PAs to reflect the PRN doses every time it is requested/needed and change the qty back to the prophylactic dosing.  Qty changes would need to be documented with rationale.  (labor intensive- who will be allowed to make changes- techs, o/n techs?)

This will ***require all PRN bleed doses*** to require a call in to GWT in order to be dispensed= undue burden on the members, pharmacy, md's and GWT= cost and time  
1. possible fix, fill limits for EO 7215 if allowed (future state)

Please check NDC to see how the quantity is being determined- vials or by units.  For the situation below, it is done by units.

**Approved PA:**

Drug and strength: Eloctate HICL- multiple strengths

DX: Severe Hemophilia A D66

**Approval Duration:** up to 365 days (Ticket placed: character limit of 6 issue- Character limit on PA-QTY field INC0021783)

**Qty/Day Supply:**

Prophylactic dose: 6633units BIW

Major bleed dose: 6560 units PRN

Moderate/mild bleed dose: 3498 PRN

**Approval Rationale:** Approval by HICL due to overlapping ndc with prophylactic and prn dosings.  Dose increase/COT/Grandfathering.  
Monthly prophylactic/maintenance dose used [6633 x 2 (BIW) x 4 weeks (28 days)= 53064]
(so input the day supply as= 28 and the total units=53064 and let in calculate the units per day which is 1895.14*)

Approved by Person: 

***When using HICL- please put the name of the medication in the Letter TEXT*** (Problem with PAs processed by HICL INC0021786)

Letter Text: sample
APPROVED MEDICATION: ELOCTATE



***Note: *1895 is less than any PRN bleed doses and therefore any PRN doses will reject with Edit 7215.  Workaround pending***
