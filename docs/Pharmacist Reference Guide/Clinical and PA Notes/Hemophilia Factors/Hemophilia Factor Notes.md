# Hemophilia Factor Notes

**Disclaimer: this information may not be reflective of the current UPDL status; please confer with the current UPDL for PA status** (provided by Prachi Patel 12/22/2022)

Check NDC Maintenance to see the units of measurement for factors.  Factors are usually entered by units. If the dose is 4500 units twice a week you would enter as 9000 per 7 days= daily dose units of 1285.714 units per day. Since it changes constantly based on what the pharmacy receives for each dispensing, they call often to ask that the units be adjusted. ( +/- 10%).


**EHL** – extended half-life factors, **P** – Preferred drug, **NP** – non-preferred drug

**Normal Factor IX Levels**: 50-150 units/dL.
