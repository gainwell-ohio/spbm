Hello,
An issue has been brought to our attention from Nationwide concerning the processing of Dupixent for small children.
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122046056/227433958-c424973c-dfb2-4921-b9e2-334a3af2fa7f.png)

In the fact that Dupixent comes in 2 syringe boxes, and the dosage of 300mg every 4 weeks for initial dosing for once every 4 weeks would either leave them a month without the initial 90 days or break a box. ODM has agreed that approving these for 4 months is appropriate to allow for correct processing and allowing the adequate trial.

For now, If an initial PA is approvable and fits this situation, please process for 4 month time period and with daily dosage of .072 to allow for 4/56 dosing.

***If a prior PA has been approved, and the call center receives a call about this situation, I originally tried to manipulate the original approved PA, it did not product a successful claim, and a new PA needed to be entered for the 56 days. I fully believe that when a call comes in matching this description, technicians are fully capable of understanding the age group of less than 6, Dupixent dosing and dispensing, and are able to create and approve a new PA for the 56 day time frame as required, and is a process that can be accomplished without a pharmacist to allow for the one time fill to complete initial dosing.***

After the 4 month initial period, renewal criteria applies.

Thanks,

Justin Collingwood
