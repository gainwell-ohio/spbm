Hello,

In an effort to save time splitting PAs to do a loading dosage and continuing dosage, and forgoing the problem of pharmacies not filling the loading dosage on time, it has been decided to implement a process of approving once for initiation dosage for the initiation time period. 
 
This is mainly for the common immunomodulator medications (Dupixent, Humira, Taltz, Skyrizi) and won’t work in all situations given the different starter dosages, but to lessen calls and increase efficiency the process has been decided to be (using Dupixent as an example):
 
1.Initial dosage for Dupixent PA comes to you for Atopic dermatitis in an Adult
 
2.Technician/Pharmacist – enter in the max starter dosage 4/14 days, Daily Dose Units to be (4/14) = .29 (roughly). Enter Days Supply as 90 to correspond to most of the immunomodulator UPDL indicated initiating days supply. Always follow the UPDL in deciding day supply for appropriateness when applicable
 
3.Technician – complete entering in the information for the PA, send to Medreview

Pharmacist – continue processing as usual (criteria, indication, trials, age limits), approve/deny as a single PA for the 90 days Daily Dose Units of 0.29
 

Admittedly this may open up some opportunities to FWA, but this is a short term window for max allowed dosage, and when we get the renewal request we will see what has been processing in a timely manner in recent claims. But at this time the trade off is that we receive many calls to update the time frame of initial dosages which wastes time for everyone involved, and hopefully multiple PAs don’t have to be made or hunted down once it comes to Medreview.


There are some instances where multiple PAs for initiation and maintenance dosages will still have to be made, For example Taltz or Humira for certain indications like hidradenitis suppurativa, will more than likely need 2 PAs approved at GCNseqNO level, but that can be decided and accomplished by the pharmacist approving. This will also lessen the chances of mistakes happening if the maintenance dosage gets approved by one person and the initial gets denied.
If any questions please ask,
Thanks,
