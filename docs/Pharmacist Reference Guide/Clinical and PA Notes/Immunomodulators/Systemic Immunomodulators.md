## Stelara Dosing 7/26/23

Stelara (ustekinumab) has been shown to be effective for treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease. Unfortunately, a large percentage of patients (>40% for UC; approximately 50% for Crohn’s) achieve suboptimal clinical response after induction and maintenance dosing of every eight (8) weeks. 

Current literature does indicate that dose intensification to every four (4) or six (6) weeks is a viable option in those patients who do not achieve clinical response at 8 weeks (Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2022 Oct;20(10) 2399-2401). This has also been supported by Gainwell Medical Directors. When reviewing requests for dose intensification, if the prescriber has indicated a sub-clinical response at standard dosing, and wishes to intensify to more frequent dosing, then please consider approving. 

7/21/23: **There is literature to support every 4 weeks dosing in certain cases of Crohn’s / UC.**
