- Preferred agents in the same class include: Byetta, Trulicity and Victoza. 
- Need 3 trials (120 days each) of 3 preferred medications (one of which must be Byetta Trulicity or Victoza).

***Coverage is provided when the member has a history of at least 120 days of therapy with THREE preferred (medication covered by the Plan) medications [ONE of the 120 day trials must be Byetta (5mcg and 10mcg), Victoza (18 MG/3 ML PEN)  or Trulicity (0.75mg, 1.5mg, 3mg and 4.5mg)], which include but are not limited to: Farxiga 5 and 10 mg, Invokana 100 mg and 300 mg, Victoza 18 MG/3 ML PEN, and Jardiance 10 and 25 mg.***

The Gainwell Policy for Medical Necessity and Ohio Unified Preferred Drug List criteria were reviewed and per Ohio Administrative Code Rule 5160-1-01 (C) and 5160-26-03 (B), a medically necessary service must include: generally accepted standards of medical practice, be clinically appropriate in administration, treatment & outcome and be the lowest cost alternative to effectively treat the condition. Please contact your provider to assist you with other treatment options that might be covered under your benefit package, or other services that might be available through the community.



3.	If using for non-FDA approved indication (anything besides weight loss) – Admin denial

***For SEMAGLUTIDE (Wegovy) requests:***
