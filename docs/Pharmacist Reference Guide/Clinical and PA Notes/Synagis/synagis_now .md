Hello,

There were some processing questions regarding Synagis requests after
2/15/23, going off of what was directed to us-  
<span style="font-family:Symbol">·</span>  In the email chain below, it
was stated (regarding cases being approved past 2/15/23): “Only very
few, severely at risk patients with extenuating circumstances should be
allowed beyond that.” How are we to appropriately determine who is
severely at risk as Synagis requests are for those that generally have
complex medical histories?  I anticipate most PAs for this will lead to
denial. Some of these may in turn become appeals. These should be
completed with a medical director’s input due to the complex clinical
nature of the situation.

<span style="font-family:Symbol">·</span>  We anticipate we will see
many of these on Appeals. Should these appeals be evaluated in
consultation with the Gainwell medical director?  Yes.

<span style="font-family:Symbol">·</span>  Has ODM sent communication to
hospitals, prescribers and pharmacies stating that the season is being
termed early? If not, when will this communication be given?  ODM sent
communication to each managed care plan regarding this information. ODM
is also a member of a listserv which includes all of the children’s
hospitals across the state of Ohio and their lab directors. This
information was disseminated via this listserv. Both SPBM and CHC were
looped into this as well.

<span style="font-family:Symbol">·</span>  Can specific references be
given to us so that we may point prescribers to the data ODM has
reviewed to make this decision, or should we direct them to the CDC
website (shown below)? We anticipate providers will want this
information during peer to peers.  CDC website is appropriate to
reference. The listserv ODM is a member of includes weekly positivity
rate updates from each individual hospital.

<span style="font-family:Symbol">·</span>  What denial language would
ODM like us to use when denying these cases beyond 2/15/2023? The
Synagis season has completed on 2/15/2023 in response to decreased and
sustained low RSV positivity rates. 

 

That means if the tech gets a call about short dated PA or denial
because of after 2/15/23, this is out of the pharmacists’ hands.

If a call does come in they need to start the appeals process.

 

Pharmacists in appeals, Synagis appeals should involve the medical
director, [<span style="font-family:
&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">@Beisler,
Anthony</span>](mailto:anthony.beisler@gainwelltechnologies.com), to
evaluate the complex clinical nature of the situation.

 

Any questions please ask,

Thanks,
