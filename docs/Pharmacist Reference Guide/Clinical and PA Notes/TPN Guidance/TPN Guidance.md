Hello,

I will give further guidance in how to assess and approve TPNs, I have done them for years in FFS, and liken them to any non-preferred IV medication.
 
First as in all things PAD or home infusion to assure it is being dispensed by a 70 pharmacy. If there is any question if in a center or medical billing it is appropriate to ask as in before:
 
**Please note this is not a denial - a prior authorization has been sent in for this member for this medication. If available, please provide the pharmacy name and NPI that is dispensing the medication or the NPI of the provider acquiring the product in a buy and bill situation. Per Rule 5160-26-13 | Managed health care programs: claim billing for pharmaceuticals., Claims for pharmaceuticals that are dispensed by pharmacy providers are billed through ODM's SPBM and for all other provider types, claims for pharmaceuticals are billed through an MCO, or in accordance with rule 5160-59-03 of the Administrative Code for individuals enrolled in the OhioRISE plan, as applicable.**
 
Then, since its not on UPDL or Additional Criteria Sheet, I would see what the medical necessity rationale is for TPN, be it mechanical malabsorption, possibly cancer, short gut syndrome, any other clinical reason as to why TPN would be required as opposed to solid/liquid ingestion.
 
Third, it is understood that many of the products involved in TPN are preferred, and may only be rejecting for one or two in the whole claim. Ideally all ingredients are usually addressed in TPN PAs, as in the compound form, and we can single out those that are PA required and process them. But if it is just a single problematic ingredient, or they send in on separate forms, Myself I would allow that too, as long as all information is present to achieve an approval. Again, very similar to an at home IV antibiotic.
 
As always try to consider the length of time of use, max of a year depending on each and every different situation, if its only requested for a couple weeks for GI surgery, or longer based on cancer or extremely detrimental health status.  When approving as a rule of thumb I generally take what they are requesting in the non preferred TPN products and add a little more for the daily dosage, in this case if nutritional need requiring additional quantities, to limit excess PAs. I am fully confident in each of you being able to assess a situation and applying logic to come to a conclusion in giving a member what they need.
 
As in other compound medications all ingredients are listed at the bottom of the claim to help with direction and daily dosage if not especially clear on form.
 
This is very lay person designed but I generally use these sorts of situations for guidance

If any questions please ask, Thanks as always
