Hello, 

There have been some recent questions associated with TPN billing/prior authorizations.

This Email is to stress the importance in verifying all meds, TPN or otherwise, that when being dispensed from a 70 provider pharmacy, are paid for through the SPBM and information found in OAC and SPBM handbook

Thanks,
