# Tzield

FYI, in case we starting seeing PAs for Tzield.
 
This excerpt is from Myers and Stauffer, they suggest the additions to the Specialty list to ODM.  It doesn’t go to a great amount of detail, this would be all that ODM is presented.

A couple of questions to consider:

- I presume this was a Specialty Pharmacy that was calling regarding the PA for the particular patients and criteria ?
- Is the intent from the pharmacy to white bag the product to deliver for administration ? 

Initially, my thought would be since this is such a new medication that if there isn’t specific clinical criteria listed per ODM, page 8 of the IPD Analytics New Drug Review that describes the PA criteria consideration would be a good place to start. Also by referencing the additional sources listed at the bottom.

Let me know if there is anything further needed and if we start seeing requests for this medication.
 
Thank you, Scott
