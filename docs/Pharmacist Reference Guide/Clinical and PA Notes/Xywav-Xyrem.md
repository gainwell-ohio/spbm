# Xyrem vs Xywav 

Just FYI....this information in the PDL is incorrect. ***Xywav does NOT require any sort of sodium restriction***; it only contains 131 mg of sodium at the recommended dose of 9 gm. Xyrem, however, at the same 9 gm dose, contains 1,640 mg of sodium, and does requires restriction of additional dietary sodium intake. Until this can be edited/fixed, please keep this in mind when reviewing cases for Xywav. Thank you.
