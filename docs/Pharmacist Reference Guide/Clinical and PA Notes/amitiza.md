â€¢	Amitiza and its generic lubiprostone, are on equal footing for the step therapy criteria, as in they just need the **2 preferreds at this time.**

## Processing Guidance

The clincal team has placed a DAW bypass override for Amitiza. When receiving a PA for Amitiza, process as GSN to allow flexibility to move from the Brand and Generic since both are preferred (as long as no other edits would prevent processing).
