Hello,

Whenever we receive a verbal PA that is lacking information and/or not on the PDF form and noted as verbal with all information , please send an e-mail to SPBMQATRAINING@mygainwell.onmicrosoft.com . Please include PA number, technician who took the verbal PA, and time remaining before TAT.
 
If no new information is given 2 hours before TAT (or if the PA is past TAT), at this time deny requesting all information that is required to achieve an approval.
 
Information that must be collected by technicians that are to be on the verbal form:

Member – name, DOB, ID

Prescriber – name, NPI, phone and fax number

Pharmacy information (if known, is extremely helpful for pharmacy 70 situations)

Drug – strength, quantity, days supply, new or renewal

Diagnosis codes

Preferred medications trials if any

Name of staff member attesting
 


Please ask if any questions, 

Thanks for all you do!
 
Justin Collingwood
