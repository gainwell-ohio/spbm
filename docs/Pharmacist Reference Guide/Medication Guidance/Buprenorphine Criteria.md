## Recommended ODM PA Criteria

Buprenorphine mono products will be approved for:

- Pregnancy
- Breastfeeding
- Contraindication to combo products (documented history of serious adverse reactions that can include moderate/severe hepatic impairment <sup>[Hepatic Impairment Clinical Information](https://special-spoon-f542dccd.pages.github.io/Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Clinical%20and%20PA%20Notes/liverimpar/?h=hepa)</sup>, allergies, anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, anaphylactic shock, hives)
	- Allergy to buprenorphine/naloxone combination product- defined as type I- IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions 
	- Including things such as rash, hives, swelling of the face, wheezing, low blood pressure, and loss of consciousness
	- Serious adverse reactions **do not include symptoms** such as:
		- Headache
		- Nausea / vomiting 
		- Dizziness
		- Diarrhea 
	- **Hepatitis is not a detailed** enough diagnosis to determine if naloxone is a contraindication
	- Intolerances are not approvable as reasons to use mono product

- Conversion from mono (ex. was pregnant and is done breast feeding) to combo product
- Patients who are being treated for use of long-acting opioids (including conversion from methadone)

**Mono products will be approved for the following time frames:** 
- Initiation:
- Pregnancy: 180 days (max per UPDL)
- Breastfeeding: 180 days (max per UPDL)
- Documented contraindication to combo: 180 days (max per UPDL)
- Conversion from mono to combo: 30 days, max 90 days
- Initiation for long-acting opioids: 30 days, max 90 days
- Maintenance: 180 days, reauth criteria as noted in UPDL/MAT PA form


**Other notes:**
Side effect profiles for both mono and combo products are similar, including nausea and headaches. 

Prescribing for buprenorphine products must follow the requirements of Ohio Administrative 
Code rule 4731-33-03 Office based treatment for opioid addiction.

Members should not be allowed to take both injectable buprenorphine and oral buprenorphine concomitantly

Each PA request (whether initiation or maintenance) must meet the buprenorphine approval criteria (pregnancy, breastfeeding, etc) and this needs to be confirmed on each PA authorization

## Templates for Approval and Denials 8/8/23

Hello,
To further help with the buprenorphine mono cases for MAT, I am including new templates specific to approving and denying, making sure that we check the form and notes for any of these addressed and specifically make sure they are mentioned in denial language when sending back, the most likely culprits will be further explaining that contraindications and side effects are not true allergies and that hepatitis is not specific enough diagnosis.

My thoughts are that you can copy and paste and focus on if approving that member is breastfeeding and you can keep that part in but more importantly in your denials if they are pushing that diarrhea is happening that you can put that in your denial notes and especially focus that  on your denial language sent to  them with including something with the denial language document a blurb about “Diarrhea is not considered an IgE mediated allergic reaction and not a basis for not using the preferred product”.

## Buprenorphine peer to peer and appeals requests

***4/3/23***

Hello, 
I am and have given the PA pharmacists the following directive involving re-review situations for generic Subutex.


Any appeal or p2p information we receive for buprenorphine mono product for opioid dependence (generic subutex), please assess if new information is provided (pregnancy, breastfeeding, IGE mediated reactions) that will allow approval, if not, ==we are to involve the medical director== to get a second opinion at this time if it involves going against the directive we have been given. We have been given the directive to deny but they may have a different perspective and can further clinically assess each situation as it comes to them. They are aware of our specific directive from ODM. We are to defer to the medical directors expertise in these situations and proceed as directed. Please include OH_MCD_PBM_clinical <OH_MCD_PBM_clinical@gainwelltechnologies.com> on all p2p and appeals for buprenorphine involving medical director in case of state hearings.

Any questions please ask,
Thanks,

Justin Collingwood

***4/20/23***

Good morning!

Adding to below guidelines for Subutex. If you are working G&A and have a review for Subutex in which the member still does NOT meet the strict criteria below on the appeal, ==please reach out to Dr. James Wood (medical director) via email for decisioning.== Please document his response in the internal notes section of the original PA (if upheld) or the new PA (if overturned).

Thank you,

Cassandra Roach, PharmD, RPh

## Rejecting in Appeals Denial Language

[weekly email 4/28/23](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/weeklyemail42823.docx?d=wc2d2297e447242f6a310e1aa4e002d2b&csf=1&web=1&e=G87tJQ){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

If rejecting an appeal for this medication when the medical director was contacted, please use the following appeal denial language and not the normal denial language for a PA:

- The appeal request has been reviewed. The Gainwell Medical Director has been consulted for additional information involving this case. The original denial has been upheld based upon guidance that intolerances are not approvable as reasons to use mono product as opposed to the preferred combination products like Suboxone or Zubsolv. Serious adverse reactions do not include symptoms such as headache, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, or diarrhea. The side effect profile for both mono and combination products are similar, including nausea and headaches. Please use the preferred combination products.
