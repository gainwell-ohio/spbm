# Drug Shortage 2/23/23

Here is the general for shortage issues:
If it is a known shortage ( Check the AHSP website) and if listed-

- Have the pharmacy process for a DAW 4 or 8
- If still having a rejection, place an EO or PA for the time stated of shortage, up to 3 months
 
If there is an unknown shortage,(still check AHSP website)

- If a PA is the notifying communication, it is stated that there is a shortage, this must be stated, and we are to take their word from it, and approve for 3 months.
- If a pharmacy calling, attempt to process a DAW 4 or 8 when possible.
- If the pharmacy is stating there is a shortage, they must send a screen shot of their invoices stating shortage or of their distributor (Cardinal, Anda) showing a shortage to OHSupervisorsandSr.Techs@mygainwell.onmicrosoft.com or Alorica_OHSPBM@mygainwell.onmicrosoft.com , these emails are to be able to be accessed by a technician to acquire the correct shortage information and craft either an override or PA, whatever is necessary to process, for 3 months.
- The documents of the invoices need to be able to be sent in when pharmacies are open, and attached to a PA or EO as required, verified and approved so members can get their medication.
 
Thanks, Please ask if any questions
