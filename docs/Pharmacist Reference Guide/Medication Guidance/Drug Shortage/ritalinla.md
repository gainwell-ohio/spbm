# Ritalin LA shortage

## 9/20/23

Please distribute to all teams and post to Evergreen ASAP! 

Good afternoon!

Currently there is a shortage in ~~brand name Vyvanse 60mg and 70mg capsules~~ as well as some Ritalin LA manufacturers ~~(both are BvG)~~. This is expected through late September at least. There is a new generic hitting shelves (for Vyvanse), but the brand name is still preferred. 

In the instance that the call center gets a call from the pharmacy for a claim rejection for generic with a PA required rejection on the claim:<ol><li>Ask the caller/pharmacy if they can run the claim for brand name with a DAW9 as brand name is the preferred product. Generic is **NOT** preferred.</li><li>If the caller indicates that they are running the generic ^^due to shortage of brand name^^, please proceed with the following steps:</li><ol><li>***Take the call like you would a verbal PA by creating a new PA in Vue360Rx from the rejected claim***.</li><ol><li>A PA form will NOT need to be filled out and uploaded.</li><li>Instead of the filling out the PA form, in the internal notes section, please state the following: ==“Request from [NAME/TITLE/PHARMACY NAME] pharmacy for PA override due to brand name shortage. Placing 90-day approval for generic. Further requests beyond 90 days will be reviewed as initial requests and not reauthorizations.”==</li><li>Fill out all the information on the ***PA to allow for 90-day supply***.</li><li>Approve the PA.</li></ol><li>Once the approval is made by the Call Center technician, advise the caller/pharmacy to reprocess the claim.</li></ol>

Thank you,
