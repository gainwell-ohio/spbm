# Trileptal Susp ( BVG ) Shortage 12/13/2023

Hello Team

ODM is approving an edit override for access to Oxcarbazepine Susp when a pharmacy self-attest they cannot secure stock of the preferred brand, Trileptal Susp.

## Rph Guidance

I believe this will be similar to Vyvanse shortages, please be aware if we get any PAs for the generic suspension.

Similar to Vyvanse/Ciprodex/Flovent as in if we see one come across our PA lap, I would expect to see an extremely high approval rate and not deny for brand, mental procedure more than technical procedure.

If the techs are handling I would hope we don’t see any, but I can hope in one hand.

I am sure it will come up in Medreview or in Tech chat, and given the medication, shortage situation, and UPDL class, do anything to get them what they need.


Thanks,

Justin


## 9/20/23 (Vyvanse shortage guidance process)

Good afternoon!

Currently there is a shortage in brand name Vyvanse 60mg and 70mg ==**capsules** (does ^^NOT^^ include CHEWABLES)== as well as some Ritalin LA manufacturers ~~(both are BvG)~~. This is expected through late September at least. There is a new generic hitting shelves (for Vyvanse), but the brand name is still preferred. 

In the instance that the call center gets a call from the pharmacy for a claim rejection for generic with a PA required rejection on the claim:<ol><li>Ask the caller/pharmacy if they can run the claim for brand name with a DAW9 as brand name is the preferred product. Generic is **NOT** preferred.</li><li>If the caller indicates that they are running the generic ^^due to shortage of brand name^^, please proceed with the following steps:</li><ol><li>***Take the call like you would a verbal PA by creating a new PA in Vue360Rx from the rejected claim***.</li><ol><li>A PA form will NOT need to be filled out and uploaded.</li><li>Instead of the filling out the PA form, in the internal notes section, please state the following: ==“Request from [NAME/TITLE/PHARMACY NAME] pharmacy for PA override due to brand name shortage. Placing 90-day approval for generic. Further requests beyond 90 days will be reviewed as initial requests and not reauthorizations.”==</li><li>Fill out all the information on the ***PA to allow for 90-day supply***.</li><li>Approve the PA.</li></ol><li>Once the approval is made by the Call Center technician, advise the caller/pharmacy to reprocess the claim.</li></ol>

Thank you,
