# Vyvanse Shortage Guidance 

## 9/20/23

Please distribute to all teams and post to Evergreen ASAP! 

Good afternoon!

Currently there is a shortage in brand name Vyvanse 60mg and 70mg capsules as well as some Ritalin LA manufacturers (both are BvG). This is expected through late September at least. There is a new generic hitting shelves (for Vyvanse), but the brand name is still preferred. 

In the instance that the call center gets a call from the pharmacy for a claim rejection for generic with a PA required rejection on the claim:<ol><li>Ask the caller/pharmacy if they can run the claim for brand name with a DAW9 as brand name is the preferred product. Generic is **NOT** preferred.</li><li>If the caller indicates that they are running the generic ^^due to shortage of brand name^^, please proceed with the following steps:</li><ol><li>***Take the call like you would a verbal PA by creating a new PA in Vue360Rx from the rejected claim***.</li><ol><li>A PA form will NOT need to be filled out and uploaded.</li><li>Instead of the filling out the PA form, in the internal notes section, please state the following: ==“Request from [NAME/TITLE/PHARMACY NAME] pharmacy for PA override due to brand name shortage. Placing 90-day approval for generic. Further requests beyond 90 days will be reviewed as initial requests and not reauthorizations.”==</li><li>Fill out all the information on the ***PA to allow for 90-day supply***.</li><li>Approve the PA.</li></ol><li>Once the approval is made by the Call Center technician, advise the caller/pharmacy to reprocess the claim.</li></ol>

Thank you,

•	Everyone If you get a generic Vyvanse capsule request due to shortage, **approve both the price rejection it is rejecting for and the PA for 90 days to cover shortage**. The price is the only reason it is not payable at this time. Clinical is working with FDB to get the pricing ASAP, but it takes time. When approving please put in approval language only for this emergency time until the price is loaded.

This medication is brand preferred over generic, this approval is only for shortage at this time. ==Please note, until pricing is loaded into the system, the dispensing pharmacy may have to contact Myers and Stauffer at 800-591-1183 for claims to process==.

In case you are hearing about generic Vyvanse, **ODM has confirmed the brand will be BvG for the time being**. We don’t have the NDCs yet, nor has it been added to the BvG list ODM sends us weekly, so not much else to go with until that time.

(So until we have another direction or the UPDL is updated, ==process Vyvanse PA's by NDC (BVG)==)
