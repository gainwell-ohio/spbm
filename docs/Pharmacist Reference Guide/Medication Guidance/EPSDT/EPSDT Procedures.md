Hello,

After gathering more descriptive information and finalizing the process,
the following information can be used in decisioning prior
authorizations for EPSDT.

 

Before admin denying anything based on rebate or payable, double check
the age to make sure member is 21 or over.

If 21 or over please admin deny

If less than 21, rebate or payable (red X situations in NDC tile), we
are to proceed as usual with decisioning disregarding this status.

 

We are to ensure it is the lowest cost alternative that effectively
addresses and treats the medical problem, meaning if there are UPDL
alternatives that are indicated to treat the condition, we still use the
hierarchy of payable, UPDL(preferred, step, nonpreferred) – Additional
Criteria Classes – then refer to Med Nec Policy.

We are also to ensure it meets generally accepted standards of medical
practice; it is clinically appropriate in its type, frequency, extent,
duration, and delivery setting; and it is appropriate to the adverse
health condition for which it is provided and is expected to produce the
desired outcome. This means we are to access if FDA approved, indicated
for the diagnosis, dosing and time expected to use are indicated, and
how given is appropriate per information we have, similar to Med Nec for
payable products.

 

If we receive a PA for one of these non-payable cases for a member under
the age of 21 that is appropriate to approve, the procedure is as
follows:

1.  <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Use
    the approval template and include verbiage in internal notes –
    <span style="background:
         yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Approving per medical necessity
    for EPSDT member</span></span>
2.  <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Approve
    the PA for standard amount of time for treatment, if chronic
    condition 365 days is acceptable </span>
3.  <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Enter
    in the Edit Override for the necessary edits that are firing in
    these situations, I forsee 7106 and 7104 being used mostly, if there
    is an edit that needs to be overridden in these cases that we are
    not able to select please contact Rachel Carpenter, Cassandra Roach,
    or I, and we will try to find the best way for the member to get
    their medication (I don’t have solid figures but I do not believe
    this should happen often)</span>

 

As far as entering in these Edits, they must be done only when a PA is
put in place and approved, and only after a pharmacist has reviewed it
for medical necessity if applicable (may still require the peer to peer
or appeals process, but not for payable status)

<span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">\*\*\*\*\*Technicians
should never be entering in these edits\*\*\*\*\*</span>

We (the pharmacists) have been given access to these edits in the
purpose that if we are able to easily apply this to this situation to
assure members can get the medication they need, we may do it when it
applies.

 

Some situations to be aware of:

If it is rejecting for 7371D : Bill as Medical Supply, this product is
more than likely to be covered under the medical portion and should be
requested under the MCE medical coverage, they can be cancelled and sent
in the ADDITIONAL INFO. CHAT FOR PHARMACISTS.

Pharmacy dispensing must still be a 70 pharmacy as in payable products.

 

Questions that were asked answered:

Does EPSDT then cover the usual non-covered diagnosis(obesity, erectile,
dysfunction) = Yes, as long as follows medical necessity.

What happens if a member is 20 and turning 21 = consider short dating
the PA to the time of when member is 21, EPSDT does not apply then. It
may be appropriate to send information in approval text to explain the
situation.

If a medication has a similar diagnosis and a payable counterpart,
should we use the payable one (Wegovy vs Ozepmic) = We would rather use
the payable option, and further clarification may be needed from the
prescriber with a call or fax back requesting this information.

 

Please ask any questions if necessary,

Thanks,
