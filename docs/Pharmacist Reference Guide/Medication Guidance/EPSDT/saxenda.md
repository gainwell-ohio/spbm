If you wanted to deny for a request for more information (and it hasn’t been supplied already), Saxenda is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management, so chart notes outlining that plan would be appropriate.
 
After that, given the direction we have so far, I would recommend approving for Saxenda under the guidance of EPSDT. From the information you provided, the patient does not have a specific diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes, therefore Victoza would not be an appropriate alternative.
If you do approve, you will also need to enter a corresponding EO for Edit 7106, since Saxenda is not payable due to being manually disabled. I checked and you do have the appropriate permission level to place that edit at this time.
 
I am sure EPSDT will be an ongoing conversation with ODM as we iron out some of the requirements.
 
Thanks,
