[Fleqsuvy_Zonisade.NCH PA overrides.MCO.20230410---LIST](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/Fleqsuvy_Zonisade.NCH%20PA%20overrides.MCO.20230410.xlsx?d=wbeb509031f3c468bb1c7e587e42fbb22&csf=1&web=1&e=ay79cG) {:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

***Effective immediately - - Fleqsuvy and zonisamide suspension  requests*** 

Please see below directive from ODM surrounding baclofen (Fleqsuvy) and zonisamide suspension requests. If we see one of these come through for a member on the list attached, please place the approval for the requested medication with ***approval dates of 4/11/23 through 4/11/24 with a daily dose of 999.*** 

Please use the following script in your internal notes:

Placing proactive approval for requested medication (GCNSeqNo level) at daily dose of 999 x 365 days (4/11/23 through 4/11/24) per ODM direction in collaboration with Kelin Wheaton at NCH. 

There is only one GCNSeqNo for Fleqsuvy and one for zonisamide suspension, so ***no need to enter at HICL level.***

I appreciate your help with this!!
