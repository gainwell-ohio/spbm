***Effective immediately - - Fleqsuvy and zonisamide suspension  requests*** 

Please see below directive from ODM surrounding baclofen (Fleqsuvy) and zonisamide suspension requests. If we see one of these come through for a member on the list attached, please place the approval for the requested medication with ***approval dates of 4/11/23 through 4/11/24 with a daily dose of 999.*** 

Please use the following script in your internal notes:

Placing proactive approval for requested medication (GCNSeqNo level) at daily dose of 999 x 365 days (4/11/23 through 4/11/24) per ODM direction in collaboration with Kelin Wheaton at NCH. 

There is only one GCNSeqNo for Fleqsuvy and one for zonisamide suspension, so ***no need to enter at HICL level.***

I appreciate your help with this!!
