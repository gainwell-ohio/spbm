# Non-formulary test strip approvals 3/17/23

Good morning team! 

I wanted to follow up on a topic in a meeting with ODM yesterday involving the approval of non-formulary test strips. It appears that we have had a lot of approvals for non-formulary test strips, specifically the Freestyle Precision Neo that is compatible with the Freestyle Libre CGM system. Many of these PA’s are stating they are requesting as member has Libre and   this is the only compatible test strip for this system.

I asked ODM what we should be doing when we get these specific requests so that we may have more direction moving forward. **They specifically stated that these requests should be denied and that we recommend the formulary test strips and meters.** This requires the member to have a formulary meter and formulary test strips to use in that meter vs. using the strips compatible with the Freestyle Libre CGM. @Carpenter, Rachel– Can we modify the denial language for these somehow to indicate that we understand that they are trying to use these with the Libre system, but that the member will need to use a formulary meter and formulary strips instead, both of which we cover? 

I am placing a screenshot below for the formulary products. Side note since we are speaking to the Preferred Diabetic Supply List… Please remember that the Libre systems and the Dexcom’s listed on the Preferred Diabetic Supply List are no PA required (may hit for QL, use of older device that is non-formulary, etc.). The language above these is there to provide direction for providers and is NOT criteria for coverage.
