Currently we are experiencing many issues with similar GCNseqNOs that are in the same HICL.
It has been said that if this situation is happening to approve at hicl level with a total dosage of all medications at this time that will allow for the fill.
Chris’ example – one was for 6 and one was for 2, HICL approve for 8 a day, at least
Brian Synagis – hicl approval for amount required, ie weight is 8.9 kg, dosage is 133.5, HICL level approval for the 1.5 to cover the 1ml and 0.5ml
