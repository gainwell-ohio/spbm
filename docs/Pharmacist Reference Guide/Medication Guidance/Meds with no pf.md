# PA Guidance for medications with no preferred alternatives 5/23/23

Good morning!!

@OH Supervisors and Sr. Techs – please forward this email to your PA techs for their visibility and understanding

Guidance for PA technicians: Ztalmy, Hyftor and Nucala requests should be sent to MEDREVIEW for pharmacist review. 

## Guidance for PA pharmacists

The below medications do have certain indications to which there are no appropriate alternatives (noted below). My recommendations to ODM are in RED, but these have not yet been updated (not sure if they will be) on ODM’s end. Please pay close attention to Ztalmy for CDD, Hyftor for facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis and Nucala when using specifically for EGPA. 

### Ztalmy
 
Ztalmy is nonpreferred, but ***none of the preferred options have an indication for CDD** 
- ***Recommend to specifically call out this medication in the criteria (similar to Epidiolex and Diacomit) and specifically state that non-preferred trials are not needed for approval (as well as any additional criteria that may be appropriate).***
 
### Hyftor

Hyftor is nonpreferred, but ***none of the preferred options have an indication for facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis*** 
– ***Recommend to add this medication to Additional Therapeutic Classes with Clinical Criteria document with any criteria that may be appropriate.*** 

### Nucala

Nucala is nonpreferred, but ***none of the preferred options have an indication for EGPA*** 
– ***Recommend to specifically call out this indication in the criteria and specifically state that non-preferred trials are not needed for approval (as well as any additional criteria that may be appropriate).***

@Castle, Amanda – Please note from a quality perspective, any review and approval by a technician (instead of sending to MEDREVIEW) will result in an auto-fail. Denials by a pharmacist for one of the indications above in which the pharmacist denies for trial and failure of preferred alternatives (not appropriate) will also result in an auto-fail.

If you have any questions, please reach out to your supervisor.

Thank you,

Cassandra Roach, PharmD, RPh
