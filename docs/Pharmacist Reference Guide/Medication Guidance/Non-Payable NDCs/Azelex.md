There are issues with no payable NDCs for preferred Azelex at this time.

From direction of ODM, we are to not allow the non-rebateable labelers that NDCs start with 16110

We are to allow the labeler 00023 if the pharmacy is dispensing a non-expired product from that manufacturer.

If we get questions regarding this medication at this time this is what must happen.
Currently the rejection is 7107 that we will see. The procedure for this will be as follows:

1. If a pharmacy calls in for a claim of Azelex, check claims to see NDC being processed 

- If NDC starts with 00023, verify the lot and expiration date on the product, and document lot and expiration date information in EO notes, and override 7107 

- If NDC starts with 16110, inform the pharmacy that the only payable option at this time is the product by labeler Abbvie, NDC starting with 00023and does require a call in to provide information for a claim to be processed. 
 
This is a process that does not require a pharmacist, so technicians are able to do it, but the correct information must be documented when calling in for an override. The availability for the ones we do accept may be scant to none, but this is the directive we have been given.
 
Any questions please ask,

Thanks,

Justin
