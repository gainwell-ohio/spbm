To this point, ODM has only been honoring previous Prior Authorizations granted by the MCOs. They are not approving new coverage requests because drugs use for treatment of obesity are excluded per OAC 5160-9-03.
 
On a slight side note, there are some discussions about notifying or “escalating” decisions on certain drugs to ODM so they are aware. I will recommend this be considered for that list.
