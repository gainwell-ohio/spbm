[PA forms Email :material-email:](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/ACCEPTABLE%20PA%20FORMS%20as%20of%2011_1_22%20%20_PLEASE%20READ_.msg?csf=1&web=1&e=LTkZAH){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

We have received new guidance regarding PA’s sent in on incorrect PA forms from management. As of 11/1/22, we have been given permission to reject PA’s that are not on correct forms specific to Gainwell. I have attached a picture of one of our forms for your reference. A complete list of the Gainwell PA forms can be found on the portal https://spbm.medicaid.ohio.gov/SPContent/DocumentLibrary/Forms. There are several different types of forms, so please familiarize yourself with what they look like. 
 
The system will filter PA’s at the fax queue level and incorrect forms will reject prior to us evening seeing them in PENDING or MEDREVIEW queues; however, we currently have a backlog of PA’s in PENDING that have come through that may be on an incorrect form.
 
What does this mean for you? What are the next steps?

1. When pulling up a PA from PENDING or MEDREVIEW, after checking member name, eligibility, drug, etc. look at the PA form and verify that it is indeed a Gainwell PA form. These are the identifiers you will look for:

**Double check that the received date is on or after 11/1/22**
	 
2. If the PA is on a Gainwell PA form, proceed with processing the PA as normal.

3. If the PA is on any other form, please use the following steps:

	- Cancel (DO NOT DENY) your case with the following note template:
		
	The Prior Authorization request was sent in using the wrong form. Provider must utilize the Gainwell {Name of Form Ex: Synagis Prior authorization form} and resubmit. Sending provider fax back.
			
	- In the **“Additional Info Needed by Tech”** chat, please use the following template:
					
 		Auth ID cancelled:  XXXX

		Drug/strength:  XXXX  XXmg
					
		Reason for fax:  The Prior Authorization request for {Member Name, DOB, Medicaid ID#, and Drug Name} was sent in using the wrong form. Please utilize the Gainwell {Name of Form} and resubmit. 

I have added technician management to the email so they are aware of this process and can disperse to technicians as appropriate.  
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions,
