# Acceptable PA Forms

10/26/23
Hi Team, 

The following guidance has been updated in the Technician Reference Guide in Evergreen. Please disseminate to your teams. 


**We should only be accepting PAs on ODM-approved Gainwell PA forms**

- We should accept PAs on the wrong type of ODM-approved Gainwell PA forms
  
	- Example - If a provider sends in an Opioid medication on a compound form, we will review the PA as normal

- We should cancel and fax back:
  
	- All non-Gainwell PA forms
  
 	- FFS PA forms

  	- Other PBM or MCE PA forms

Thanks!

Emily Reinhart, CPhT 


***It must be on a Gainwell form***, but we are to accept any of the various forms. For example, we are to accept a Hep C request on a Standard Gainwell form. We can accept an opioid on the Standard Gainwell form, etc.

This is called out in the new PA process mapping as well.

Thank you,


Cassandra Roach, PharmD, RPh

## Process if received in Medreview

If a PA request is not on a Gainwell Technology PA request form and it reaches the Medreview queue, rphs should document in the notes "Wrong PA form; not on GWT form" and change the status back to "Pending" and submit.

This aligns with other process located here: [Sending PA's back to Pending](https://special-spoon-f542dccd.pages.github.io/Clinical%20and%20Technical%20Reference%20Guide/PA%20-%20Standard%20of%20Work/back_to_pending/?h=pending)

## Archived

~~We have received new guidance regarding PA’s sent in on incorrect PA forms from management. As of 11/1/22, we have been given permission to reject PA’s that are not on correct forms specific to Gainwell. I have attached a picture of one of our forms for your reference. A complete list of the Gainwell PA forms can be found on the portal [https://spbm.medicaid.ohio.gov/SPContent/DocumentLibrary/Forms](https://spbm.medicaid.ohio.gov/SPContent/DocumentLibrary/Forms). There are several different types of forms, so please familiarize yourself with what they look like.~~ 

 
~~The system will filter PA’s at the fax queue level and incorrect forms will reject prior to us evening seeing them in PENDING or MEDREVIEW queues; however, we currently have a backlog of PA’s in PENDING that have come through that may be on an incorrect form.~~
 
~~What does this mean for you? What are the next steps?~~

~~1. When pulling up a PA from PENDING or MEDREVIEW, after checking member name, eligibility, drug, etc. look at the PA form and verify that it is indeed a Gainwell PA form. These are the identifiers you will look for:~~
	
~~**Top** of page will look like this~~

~~**Bottom** of page will look like this~~

![Alt text](acceptable_pa_forms_2.png)
	
	 
~~**Double check that the received date is on or after 11/1/22**~~
	 
~~2. If the PA is on a Gainwell PA form, proceed with processing the PA as normal.~~

~~3. If the PA is on any other form, please use the following steps:~~

- ~~Cancel (DO NOT DENY) your case with the following note template:~~
		
~~The Prior Authorization request was sent in using the wrong form. Provider must utilize the Gainwell {Name of Form Ex: Synagis Prior authorization form} and resubmit. Sending provider fax back.~~
			
- ~~In the **“Additional Info Needed by Tech”** chat, please use the following template:~~
					
~~Auth ID cancelled:  XXXX~~

~~Drug/strength:  XXXX  XXmg~~
					
~~Reason for fax:  The Prior Authorization request for {Member Name, DOB, Medicaid ID#, and Drug Name} was sent in using the wrong form. Please utilize the Gainwell {Name of Form} and resubmit.~~

~~I have added technician management to the email so they are aware of this process and can disperse to technicians as appropriate.~~
 
~~Please let me know if you have any additional questions,~~
 
Cassandra Roach, PharmD, RPh
