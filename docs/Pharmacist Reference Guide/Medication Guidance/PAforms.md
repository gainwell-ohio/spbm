# Acceptable PA Forms

11/10/2023

Following the new Cancellation Procedures that we all learned at our ODM trainings this week. Please see the update below about reviewing Non-ODM approved Gainwell PA forms. For example, a PA form from Molina or another MCE or PBM. 


1) **We will decision ALL PA forms received using our normal PA processes. Regardless of the type of form that the information is on. We review all information the same, as if the documentation is on the correct form**. 

**Even if Caresource, Molina or a PA form from another PBM**


Additionally, with everyone getting on the same page with processes. Processes are going to change. All changes will be communicated to all teams and added to Evergreen but please do not save and share screenshots on Evergreen without making sure that the guidance you are sending out is the most recent in Evergreen.
