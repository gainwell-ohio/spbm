## Samples Do Not Count as Trial

[Ozempic email](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/RE_%20Ozempic%20_ENCRYPT_.msg?csf=1&web=1&e=behzsk){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Good morning!

We have been getting a lot of requests from prescribers (specifically Dr. Paul Adkins) for Ozempic and Mounjaro with questionable trial dates. Provider is now stating that the member has trialed samples. 

***Please note that samples are NOT accepted as trials and we should be denying for appropriate trials for these medications.*** 

Anything questionable on these requests, please forward to Rachel or myself to send on to compliance for further investigation.
