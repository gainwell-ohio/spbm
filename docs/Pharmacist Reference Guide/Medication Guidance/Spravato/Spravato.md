## Archived 1/5/23 Guidance

Hello,
It as been brought to my attention that there are several rural outpatient centers that are not able to have a psych specialist due to location and are able to be registered as a REMS certified center.

In this we are really not able to enforce a psychiatrist prescribing since they are approved as REMS and no specific criteria for this in indications/package insert or lacking criteria from ODM.

So the updated guidance for Spravato looks as this:
