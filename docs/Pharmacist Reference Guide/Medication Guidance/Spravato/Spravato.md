# Spravato 1.5.23

Hello,
It as been brought to my attention that there are several rural outpatient centers that are not able to have a psych specialist due to location and are able to be registered as a REMS certified center.

In this we are really not able to enforce a psychiatrist prescribing since they are approved as REMS and no specific criteria for this in indications/package insert or lacking criteria from ODM.

So the updated guidance for Spravato looks as this:
 
1. Member is 18 
 
2. **Medication is administered in a Spravato REMS certified center** (psychiatrist no longer required)
 
3. Member / Prescriber plans to or is adhering to be monitored for at least 2 hours at each treatment session, followed by an assessment to determine when the member is considered clinically stable and ready to leave the healthcare setting 
 
4. Member has tried / failed 2 medications in Central Nervous System (CNS) Agents: Antidepressants and will concurrently using an antidepressant while in treatment. 
 
5. Pharmacy 70 supplier must be providing medication 
 
6. Approval for initial dosage- 
 
APPROVAL BY HICL PLEASE – this allows them to change dosages up and down as needed 
 
Major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation:84 down to 56mg twice a week. HICLseqNO APPROVAL, 30 DAYS SUPPLY, 0.86 DAILY DOSE UNITS (6 PACKS FOR 7 DAYS) 
 
Treatment resistant depression 56-84mg twice a week. HICLEseqNO APPROVAL, PLEASE APPROVE FOR INITIAL DAYS SUPPLY OF 60 DAYS, 0.86 DAILY DOSE UNITS (QUANTITY OF 6 PACKETS FOR 7 DAYS). This will allow for titration up and down as necessary. 
 
7. Renewal – 
 
MDD with suicidal ideation: The use of SPRAVATO, in conjunction with an oral antidepressant, beyond 4 weeks has not been systematically evaluated in the treatment of depressive symptoms in patients with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior, Continuation of Spravato beyond 4 weeks has not been established for the same episode. If this is a new suicidal ideation episode, must follow initial criteria. 
 
TRD – Dosing is either 56 or 84mg once or every 2 weeks. Member must have concurrently used antidepressant and improvement in initial response defined below. APPROVE FOR 180 MONTHS DAYS SUPPLY, HICLseqNO, WITH A DAY DOSE UNITS OF 0.43 (3PAKS / 7 DAYS) 
 
Approval Text: This prior authorization is approved for Spravato 56mg and 84mg dosages. For renewal, member must have concurrently used antidepressants and shown improvement from the member’s baseline depression status using an appropriate rating scale [for example: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS), Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)]. 
 
**The above text is only for TRD, MDD with suicidal ideation is on an episode by episode basis, no renewal information to be given.**
 
The one note will be updated, please ask if any questions
