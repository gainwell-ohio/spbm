# Subsequent Authorization Criteria/Reauthorization

Beginning January 2023 and with a few minor exceptions, all therapeutic categories have the same standardized outline format on the OHUPDL. Part of this format is for Subsequent Authorization Criteria (Reauthorization).

We reached out to clinical and ODM for clarification around this statement and what would be required as documentation.
 
For Reauthorization, please review for documentation (chart notes, PA request, written notes, etc.) **and/or** attestation of clinical stabilization. 
Per ODM, for documentation of continuation an attestation is sufficient (for example: checking the box for patient stability/positive clinical response/clinical stabilization) AND/OR documentation of patient’s response.
