## Immunomodulators for Systemic Inflammatory Disease - Initial 90-day authorizations

**We would never want to use for any Xeljanz IR approval as this will allow payment for non-preferred XR and solution**

1.	Drugs will be entered and approved at the ***HICL level*** for the initial 90-day authorization ***(except for Xeljanz IR, which will be loaded by GCNSeqNo).*** 
2.	Daily dose units will be input to reflect the ***highest possible daily dose*** needed to allow for loading doses to pay as instructed on the DLP. 
3.	Approval will be loaded for ***90 days duration.*** **Only exception to 90-days is pediatric Dupixent dosing in which may be extended to 120 days due to breaking boxes at the pharmacy.**

2.	Daily dose units will be input to reflect the daily dose needed for maintenance dosing.
3.	Approval for reauthorization will be loaded for 365 days (no exceptions).

## Dupixent-small kids

[Dupixent- small kids](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/Dupixent%20for%20small%20children.msg?csf=1&web=1&e=ZXvMn9){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Hello,
An issue has been brought to our attention from Nationwide concerning the processing of Dupixent for small children.
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122046056/227433958-c424973c-dfb2-4921-b9e2-334a3af2fa7f.png)

***In the fact that Dupixent comes in 2 syringe boxes, and the dosage of 300mg every 4 weeks for initial dosing for once every 4 weeks would either leave them a month without the initial 90 days or break a box. ODM has agreed that approving these for 4 months is appropriate to allow for correct processing and allowing the adequate trial.***

For now, If an initial PA is approvable and fits this situation, please process for 4 month time period and with daily dosage of .072 to allow for 4/56 dosing.

If a prior PA has been approved, and the call center receives a call about this situation, I originally tried to manipulate the original approved PA, it did not product a successful claim, and a new PA needed to be entered for the 56 days. I fully believe that when a call comes in matching this description, technicians are fully capable of understanding the age group of less than 6, Dupixent dosing and dispensing, and are able to create and approve a new PA for the 56 day time frame as required, and is a process that can be accomplished without a pharmacist to allow for the one time fill to complete initial dosing.

After the 4 month initial period, renewal criteria applies.

Thanks,

Justin Collingwood
