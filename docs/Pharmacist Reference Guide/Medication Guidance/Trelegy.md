# Trelegy 

- Once-daily TRELEGY is a prescription medicine used long term to treat COPD, including chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both and to treat asthma in adults. 
      - TRELEGY 100/62.5/25 mcg is the only strength approved for COPD.
- Trelegy Ellipta is an orally inhaled medicine that contains three medications in one inhaler.
- Trelegy combines the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone with two long-acting bronchodilators: vilanterol, a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA), and umeclidinium, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (anticholinergic).
- Trelegy is the first FDA-approved, single inhaler, triple therapy for once-daily maintenance treatment of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults.
- **Limitations of Use:** TRELEGY is not used to relieve sudden breathing problems and will not replace a rescue inhaler. TRELEGY should not be used in children younger than 18 years of age. It is not known if TRELEGY is safe and effective in children younger than 18 years of age.
 
Per the UPDL, criteria states: Must have had an inadequate clinical response of at least 14 days with at least two preferred drugs within the same class and duration of action.
