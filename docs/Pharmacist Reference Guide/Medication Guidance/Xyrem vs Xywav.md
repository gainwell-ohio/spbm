# Xyrem Vs Xywav additional criteria information

[Xyrem Vs Xywav additional criteria information](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/Xyrem%20Vs%20Xywav%20additional%20criteria%20information.msg?csf=1&web=1&e=FJimeO){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Hello,

With the discussion on the following additional criteria information for Xywav vs Xyrem, it was brought up at the clinical meeting for further clarification on the confusing parts of it.

Xyrem does have the following warning involving sodium intake, so it seems like it should be the one with the sodium restricted diet.

This would mean that those that are sensitive to sodium would have to keep in mind the dosage of Xyrem they are taking when at the higher usual dosages at night, it would pretty much consume half of that patient’s sodium content a day of a DASH diet max of 2300mg.

Xywav manufacturer does have this blurb on their website about why it was developed:

So with the statement about Xywav needing sodium restriction was described to as:

Xyrem : sodium content doesn’t really affect a person who is not sodium restrictive. Say a person who is no diet restrictions, would eat French fries 5 times a week. It isn’t healthy, but technically they are not on any sodium restriction so they could also take Xyrem, unfortunately in diets it’s not healthy but if not restricted the sodium content of Xyrem can basically be ignored.

***Xyrem*** : sodium content doesn’t really affect a person who is not sodium restrictive. Say a person who is no diet restrictions, would eat French fries 5 times a week. It isn’t healthy, but technically they are not on any sodium restriction so they could also take Xyrem, unfortunately in diets it’s not healthy but if not restricted the sodium content of Xyrem can basically be ignored.

***Xywav*** : ***Xywav should be used in restrictive diets*** because Xyrem at the maximum dosage would take up half of the sodium that would be ingested. The sodium daily intake needs to be conserved as much as possible, and Xywav will help with this and allow someone to still stick to a sodium restrict diet while allowing to eat. It would be found to be an unnecessary precaution to try to restrict French fry eater sodium intake with Xywav because they not in an attempt to conserve sodium intake and will eat as much of it as possible.

***It was also stated that to satisfy this criteria requirement we do not have to have chart notes to specify or to show adherence to the diet, we can accept a statement on a PA that member requires a sodium restrictive diet, so Xywav is needed.***

Please ask if any questions, if needed we can try to further clarify 
Thanks
