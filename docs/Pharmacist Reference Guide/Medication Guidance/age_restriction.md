Hello!
Please be aware that the age restrictions will be implemented in full starting tomorrow.
Most are based on correct indications.  Just looking at the list, I have a feeling we will see some off label uses in things, especially Namenda and Aricept for ADHD or other cognitive things. 

***Please be aware and use our clinical resources such as Lexicomp to verify dosing and uses.***

Thanks!

Justin
