•	~~Hydrocortison Acetate 25mg suppositories PAs are a little different. Technicians and pharmacists – Most are labeled DESI, some manufacturers have had the FDA requirements complete so they are not DESI, and are green in our system. They do require PA. If a PA comes in for this and approved, the pharmacy must use the preferred NDCs as the DESI ones will still reject.~~
