## EO Follow-up Deplin 7/13/23


Hello!
This is the specific GCN that was mentioned to not approve for medical food

I would strongly consider other formulations that do not have FDA indications or are medical food to ***not be EPSDT eligible.***

This is a general list of medical foods from Lexi with what they are normally used for, not indicated, but if on this list I would strongly recommend double checking indications and heavily scrutinize our payability of it
Medical Foods Product Table (Lexi-Drugs) - Lexicomp

As directed I would admindeny please,
Thanks
Justin
