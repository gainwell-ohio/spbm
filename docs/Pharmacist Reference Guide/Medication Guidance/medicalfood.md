DME/Medical food situations that may come across our paths. **We do cover spacers and nebulizer masks, not the nebulizer/tubing itself.**

We do NOT cover blood pressure cuffs or machines. When trying to contemplate if a product is a medical supply or benefit exclusion an edit that may pop and further description in NDC tile may help guide.

If we do get what is perceived to be a DME product like diapers, nebulizers, nutritional supplements or caloric replacement like ensure or thickeners, blood pressure machines, medical food (other than deplin) to give the prescriber and patient the most information possible please provide **denial language** as in this scope:

**Regular Deny** : Please refer to denial language document for current DL.

DME products should not got through us, many of these products are diapers, humidifiers, nebulizers, blood pressure machines, etc. As for all medical supplies, unfortunately for us there are green products in the NDC tiles usually and will be there until/if the NDC tile gets accurately cleaned up. But if ever questioning because of the product it will usually have under federal rebate in the pricing section of NDC Maintenance Tile medical supply as shown:

Phexy vitamins have been a medication that has been identified as a medical food that can be found to be approved under medical necessity

Search: methylfolate, methyl-folate, levomefolate, l-folate

## Deplin

This is the specific GCN that was mentioned to not approve for medical food

I would strongly consider other formulations that do not have FDA indications or are medical food to **not be EPSDT eligible.**
