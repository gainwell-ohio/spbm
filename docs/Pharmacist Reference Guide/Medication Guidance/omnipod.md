Hi Justin-

We do not believe that we should approve all Omnipod PAs as 15 for 30 days.  Based on the Omnipod user guide, **the only drug listed that can only be used for up to 48 hours instead of 72 hours is Apidra**.  Also, it seems the FDA guidance relates to insulin pump, not specifically Omnipod. Hopefully, this helps but let us know if you think we need more clarification for the PA team.  Thanks!

## Clinical Notes

- Each pod can hold up to 200 units of ==U-100 insulin== 
- Each pod is good up to 72 hours
- **Exception** - ==Apidra is only good for 48hrs = 15 pods per month==

***Example:***

1. If a member is using 66 units OR less of U-100 insulin then 10 pods should last 30days
2. If a member is using 67-100 units of U-100 insulin then 15 pods should last 30 days
