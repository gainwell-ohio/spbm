Oncology Meds

Check claims to see the situation that is causing the issues at the pharmacy level.

•	All  cancer meds get entered in at step therapy level, if that eases preferred/non-preferred status
•	If I had a choice, I would rather do cancer/TPN/IV/Subutex PAs all day, rather than GLP-1, Nurtec, or any other classes of medications.


1. Please pull up claims to see what rejection reasons are, cost edits may apply.
2. Be weary of IV meds or prescriber administered drugs, 70 pharmacy(Evergreen) applies.
3. Most will not have a class or spot on additional criteria, but some do, please check.
4. If required use Med Nec, it specifically has a section on the Med Nec policty (Evergreen)
5. If on label, I tend to make sure it follows indications per Lexicomp, usually will give the medications to try before the medication or in combination with, please make sure this is being done.
6. There is no “preferreds” for most things, all step therapy, please consider approving per indication.
7. If off label please use the med nec policy for off label oncology below.
8. Also please consider the prescribers specialty (oncology), other medications tried, reason for why they are using this one as opposed to indicated medications, age, severity etc.

    reviewed journals demonstrates safety and efficacy for the specified condition in a 
    comparable population (e.g., age group, level of disease severity, etc.)

        this may be taken into consideration by the clinician reviewer.
