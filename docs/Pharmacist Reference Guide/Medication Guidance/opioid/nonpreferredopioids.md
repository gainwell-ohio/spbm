â€¢	It has been verified that for the criteria involving Analgesic Agents: Opioids that the additional criteria skipping for the identified diagnosis of cancer/palliative care/amputation etc are reasons to forgo the additional criteria as cited on the opioid form, **BUT** this ^^does not apply to the preferred trials for non-preferred agents.^^ ***To use a non-preferred, it has been expressed that they still need preferred medication trials to use non-preferreds or rationale not to use.***


***We do again heavily have to use clinical rationale; digestive issues with long acting oral formulations, MED obtainment with certain medications limitations, any scrap of evidence that can be documented for your reasons to not use a preferred in the cases of cancer that can be documented and referenced.***
