Hello,

Here are the overviews of the directives to be given out since the Ohio training. When you have time either Friday, this weekend, or Monday morning as soon as possible. I will be sharing an attestation statement that is to be signed and dated.
These are the guidances to be followed, I can not stress enough that it is to cover MOST situations, but in the event there is something that you have to use your rationale for I have full confidence you can use all your intelligence at your disposal and document all reasons and information you have for those downstream.
@Nguyen, Christopher please post all the information above and the attestation document on evergreen at earliest convenience.

Thanks,
Justin
