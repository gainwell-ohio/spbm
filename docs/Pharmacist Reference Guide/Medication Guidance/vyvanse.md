## 9/15/23

**NOTE to Techs**: if you receive a PA request for generic Vyvanse that are ^^rejecting with additional edits other than PA required, please send those to Medreview^^.


[Weekly Email 9/17/23](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/EQHIiVRMV0JItdE1xbrH084BeLCDc-v0jIcpNVe5-T1UUA?e=jonYgh){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

•	Everyone If you get a generic Vyvanse capsule request due to shortage, **approve both the price rejection it is rejecting for and the PA for 90 days to cover shortage**. The price is the only reason it is not payable at this time. Clinical is working with FDB to get the pricing ASAP, but it takes time. When approving please put in approval language only for this emergency time until the price is loaded.

This medication is brand preferred over generic, this approval is only for shortage at this time. ==Please note, until pricing is loaded into the system, the dispensing pharmacy may have to contact Myers and Stauffer at 800-591-1183 for claims to process==.

In case you are hearing about generic Vyvanse, **ODM has confirmed the brand will be BvG for the time being**. We don’t have the NDCs yet, nor has it been added to the BvG list ODM sends us weekly, so not much else to go with until that time.

(So until we have another direction or the UPDL is updated, ==process Vyvanse PA's by NDC (BVG)==)
