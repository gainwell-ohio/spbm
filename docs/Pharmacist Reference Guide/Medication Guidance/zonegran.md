# Brand Zonegran

11/13/2023

**Issue:** Brand Zonegran is a non-payable NDC (red x) in Vue360rx</br>
**Question:** If there is a long history of Brand name exepecially prior to Medicaid, can we approve it?</br>
**Answer:** Yes, only for this medication situation, in the past ODM has specifically approved brand if neurologist said so. (Place EO 7104)

Hello!

This seems to be happening a lot these days. I believe It is appropriate to approve 7104 for continuation of brand names for this medication.

Thanks,
Justin

PA number: 000685209  
Edit number to override: 7104D:NON-PARTICIPATING MFG    
Approval rationale:  Note that patient is an adult and does not qualify for EPSDT review…….  Is COT, approved PA on file for BRAND Zonegran 25mg 08/11/2023-8/09/2024  (000478442); verified paid claims (most recent for 25mg strength 9/5/2023). PA Form states patient has been taking since 2003 with positive therapeutic effect…….. PA Form requesting for BRAND as DAW 1,  is currently rejecting for 7104 as above; the BRAND Zonegran 25mg is Red X per NDC Maintenance tile (and only generics have a green $, with PA Not Required).  

I have paused this case in my queue for now, and it looks like TAT is 20:38.  
Thanks so much,
Joelle
