If you disagree with the decision made by the Gainwell Prior Authorization team, the following 
paragraphs highlight your options.

You have the option to request a peer to peer reconsideration review. During this review, you 
will be able to speak with a Gainwell medical director to have a clinical discussion and submit 
any additional rationale as to why the denial should be overturned. Please contact the Gainwell 
Peer-to-Peer line at 1-833-491-0355, or submit an online request at 
https://spbm.medicaid.ohio.gov to schedule a time with our medical 
director. You will receive a call back from the Gainwell Prior Authorization Department to 
schedule ==your appointment with the medical director within 3 business days of the call request==.

Both you, and the member in question, have the right to appeal this decision. ==You may ask for 
an appeal within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of this notice==. ==Gainwell will provide an 
answer to your appeal within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date you contacted us==. If you 
believe fifteen (15) calendar days could seriously jeopardize your patient’s life, physical or 
mental health or ability to attain, maintain, or regain maximum function, please have your 
patient contact Gainwell Member Services as soon as possible to expedite their review 
process.


**You can submit an appeal by:**

- Calling Provider Services at 1-833-491-0344. **(not recommended since new and supporting documents should be sent in at the time of the appeals request).**
- Logging into the Gainwell Provider Portal, at https://spbm.medicaid.ohio.gov.

1-833-679-5491.

- The patient’s full name and member ID number
- The prescriber’s name
- The reason you disagree with the outcome provided by Gainwell Pharmacy Services
- Any additional documentation or information to support your request to have the 
decision changed

If we do not change our decision as a result of the appeal, both you, and the member in 
question, will be notified of the right to request a state hearing. Your patient or their authorized 
representative must request a hearing within 90 calendar days from the notification date of 
their denied appeal. The appeal process must be completed before a state hearing can be 
requested.
