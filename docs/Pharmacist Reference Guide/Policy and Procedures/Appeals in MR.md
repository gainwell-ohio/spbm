Hi.
Here is the new process when we encounter an appeals in Medreview.  In these situations, we need to transfer the document to Process Manager.   The steps are listed below.

## Procedure
1.	When we do get an appeal in the PA queues,  we want to ***Hit the download button, save as PDF on our computer.***

2.	From Vue360Rx,  go to the Supporting Systems drop down menu and choose ***Process Manager*** (may require log-in).

3.	Upon entering Process Manager, click on the gear icon with the person in it.
