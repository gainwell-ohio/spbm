#  Brand vs Generic BVG

[Weekly Newsletter 9/30/23](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com.mcas.ms/:w:/g/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Ee8xpAgp-SFFnLMdXceHSyIBUI18Re2GVRUtBFGZ4MDcBw?e=pCKFCy){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Please view and understand the BvG information on Evergreen, and make sure to understand that if a generic NDC is being requested, it should be denied not cancelled.

## BVG examples

10/24/23 [Denial examples](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/EUuH1dPaJwVOhD7uGbxEJusBOcL_dWWhkclm_Pk04Z27Mw?e=AnSSFj){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Hello!
Here are the examples that were discussed yesterday.

Basically rules as they have been given to me:
We go by what is specifically on the form. Eilidel is Elidel. Pimecrolimus is Pimecrolimus. Pimecrolimus is NOT Elidel.

Again, not going through every possible situation that could ever happen, if they click the box that says brand requested but requesting generic, if you take situations as you think you need to, please just explain in notes as specifically as needed to understand why you made the choice you did.

Thanks, I am sure there will be plenty of discussion. There will be more to come, but I wanted to get this to you to see examples.

Justin

 ~~Please use the following template when sending to ***Additional Info for BvG:***~~


## Template
~~Auth ID Cancelled:~~

~~Drug/strength:~~

~~Reason for fax: Brand Preferred over Generic~~

~~The following medication [xxxx] has been requested for your patient. The plan covers the brand name medication [xxxx] without a prior authorization. Please have the pharmacy process the brand name medication using a DAW 9 when processing the prescription. If the non-preferred medication (the medication that is NOT covered by the plan) is required, please re-submit the prior authorization request for review with a statement that the non-preferred medication is being requested and include the clinical reasons that the preferred medication cannot be used.~~

~~**Rphs to post in the "ADDITIONAL INFO. NEEDED BY RPH" chat group for a technician to send out a BVG letter.~~

~~If a call is taken by the call center team by from a pharmacy provider, technician receiving the call can inform the pharmacy that brand is preferred and must be processed correctly instead of generic.
If a call is taken by the call center team by a prescriber, the technician will inform the prescriber that brand is preferred over generic.~~
 
~~If a PA is received by OCR in pending OR in sent in at PA fax que, the technician will send a fax back to the prescriber informing them that brand is preferred over generic, note that in PA notes, and then cancel the PA.
If a PA is received by a pharmacist in Medreview, The PA pharmacist will post in additional information informing of the brand over generic situation note this on the PA notes and cancel the PA, the technician processing will send the fax to the prescriber, and then note this on the cancelled PA notes.~~
 
~~Please note it is understood this can change, but this is a tentative plan to calm the storm approaching.
If it is decided that calls to the pharmacy are required to process the preferred brand over the generic, this may be a consideration to help with members claims, but with the expected volume of the issues that will be happening it is not feasible at this time to require a call back on each PA we will receive regarding this.~~
