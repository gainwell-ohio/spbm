If a call is taken by the call center team by from a pharmacy provider, technician receiving the call can inform the pharmacy that brand is preferred and must be processed correctly instead of generic.
If a call is taken by the call center team by a prescriber, the technician will inform the prescriber that brand is preferred over generic.
 
If a PA is received by OCR in pending OR in sent in at PA fax que, the technician will send a fax back to the prescriber informing them that brand is preferred over generic, note that in PA notes, and then cancel the PA.
If a PA is received by a pharmacist in Medreview, The PA pharmacist will post in additional information informing of the brand over generic situation note this on the PA notes and cancel the PA, the technician processing will send the fax to the prescriber, and then note this on the cancelled PA notes.
 
Please note it is understood this can change, but this is a tentative plan to calm the storm approaching.
If it is decided that calls to the pharmacy are required to process the preferred brand over the generic, this may be a consideration to help with members claims, but with the expected volume of the issues that will be happening it is not feasible at this time to require a call back on each PA we will receive regarding this.
