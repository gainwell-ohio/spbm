# Coordination of Benefits

COB -COB stands for Coordination of Benefits.  This is when a member has more than one plan for their pharmacy benefit. 
	o If you see COB Pharmacy in VUE360RX this means we show that the member has a primary payer. 
	o You must click the thumbnail beside the COB Pharmacy line to see the name of the primary payer. 
Medicaid is usually the payer of last resort.  The ONLY exception is if the member has BCMH (Bureau for Children with Medical Handicaps).

## COB Procedures
[Edit 7011 Clarification](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/FW%20Edit%207011%20Clarification.msg?csf=1&web=1&e=1WzJiA){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Good morning.   I just wanted to clarify a process with everyone as I am seeing confusion from the Call Center reps. 

For edit 7011, we should try to have the pharmacy bill the primary coverage first using OCC 2 and then OCC 3 if the primary insurance rejects the claim.  If the pharmacy is unable or unwilling to bill using the COB process, please have the agent complete the following steps: 

•	The agent should reach out to the primary insurance on the claim to confirm coverage.
•	If the coverage has termed, ***an edit override is appropriate.***   
•	The agent should also document who they spoke to at the primary insurance to confirm the coverage termination.   
•	After providing the EO (so that the member can receive their medication), the agent should send an email to SPBM Eligibility so that we can remove the COB Pharmacy span.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.
