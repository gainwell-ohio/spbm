# Coordination of Benefits

COB -COB stands for Coordination of Benefits.  This is when a member has more than one plan for their pharmacy benefit. 
	o If you see COB Pharmacy in VUE360RX this means we show that the member has a primary payer. 
	o You must click the thumbnail beside the COB Pharmacy line to see the name of the primary payer. 
Medicaid is usually the payer of last resort.  The ONLY exception is if the member has BCMH (Bureau for Children with Medical Handicaps).

## COB Procedures
[Edit 7011 Clarification](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/FW%20Edit%207011%20Clarification.msg?csf=1&web=1&e=1WzJiA){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Good morning.   I just wanted to clarify a process with everyone as I am seeing confusion from the Call Center reps. 

For edit 7011, we should try to have the pharmacy bill the primary coverage first using OCC 2 and then OCC 3 if the primary insurance rejects the claim.  If the pharmacy is unable or unwilling to bill using the COB process, please have the agent complete the following steps: 

•	The agent should reach out to the primary insurance on the claim to confirm coverage.
•	If the coverage has termed, ***an edit override is appropriate.***   
•	The agent should also document who they spoke to at the primary insurance to confirm the coverage termination.   
•	After providing the EO (so that the member can receive their medication), the agent should send an email to SPBM Eligibility so that we can remove the COB Pharmacy span.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

## COB billing guide

[Updated COB billing guide](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/Updated%20COB%20billing%20guide.msg?csf=1&web=1&e=x4UzVP){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

How to navigate COB rejects
 
1. Prescription rejects for member having another primary insurance (7011 edit)
2. Instruct pharmacy to bill the primary insurance BIN, PCN and ID (enrollment ID shown next to primary) that shows up in a rejection as the primary insurance and Gainwell as secondary
3. Once the primary is billed and the claim rejects, see the following rejection codes and next steps:

4. Once you determine why claim rejecting, if an email to the Eligibility Team is needed, you can help the pharmacy override primary in their system:
- Pharmacy bill with "OCC 1"- only if pharmacy sure no other insurance coverage since Medicare payer of last resort. Meaning all other insurance coverage needs to be billed before Medicaid
- Pharmacy bill with "OCC 2" if primary pays for portion of claim. 

-	Claim may reject again per pharmacy needs to enter amount primary pays and then what is left for Gainwell

	a. OPAP – Other Payer Amount Paid -This is the amount that the primary payer paid towards the claim

	b. OPPRA – Other Payer Patient Responsibility Amount -This is the dollar amount left over from the primary payer and the amount that is being billed to Ohio Medicaid.

- Pharmacy bill with "OCC 3" if primary rejects claim

-	If a pharmacy reports unable to bill using "OCC 3", please refer the caller to their supervisor for assistance with COB billing. As we are not permitted to provide overrides. We can remove TPL once OCC 3 is billed and the primary rejects for 65-69.

- Pharmacy bill with "OCC 4" if primary pays $0 on claim, but claim is not rejected
