# Denial- PA day supply

[Denial- PA day supply](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/PA%20Denial%20day%20supply%20-%20New%20process.msg?csf=1&web=1&e=Y9H52L){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

Good afternoon!
 
Touching base regarding PA denials for pharmacists. Effective immediately, ***when denying a case, please change the day’s supply to 1*** instead of leaving as the requested dates of service (Ex: 2/7/23-2/7/24 for 1 year approval). We have been advised to do this to prevent issues with dates overlapping with potential future iPA’s for the same GCNSeqNo. Eventually, technicians will be updating the date to a 1 day supply prior to sending to MEDREVIEW, but this will not be completed until later in the week. In the event that the pharmacist approves out of MEDREVIEW, it will be our responsibility to update the day’s supply, daily dose, quantity requested and approval dates prior to sending the approval letter. 
 
I will also place in RPh chat for visibility.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions!
 
Cassandra Roach, PharmD, RPh
