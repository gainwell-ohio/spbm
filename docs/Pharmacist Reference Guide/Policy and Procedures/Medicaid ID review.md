Good afternoon!!! 

  We have new direction from ODM regarding the member's Medicaid ID's that are listed on the PA forms. All PA's starting 2/10 (make sure you are looking at the timestamp on the actual fax) to current - please make sure we are checking the Medicaid ID on the form against what we have in our system. 
- If the Medicaid ID on the request form IS THE SAME as what we have in our system, please document that you've checked this in your internal notes and that they match.  
- If the Medicaid ID on the request form is NOT THE SAME as what we have in our system, we can cancel with faxback with the following direction. 
	
  1. Change the day's supply to 1 day.
	
  2. Internally notate that you are cancelling with fax back to provider as the Medicaid ID listed on the form does not match what we have in our system. 
	
  3. In the ADDITIONAL INFO chat. Please use the following template for faxback:                                                                                      
		The Prior Authorization request for {Member Name, DOB, Medicaid ID#, Drug Name} is incomplete and is missing the following: Starting 2/10/2023, Gainwell Technologies SPBM will no longer accept PAs without the correct 12-digit Medicaid ID. Please resubmit with the correct Medicaid ID.
	
  4. CANCEL in the Vue360Rx system

Please let me know if you have any questions!
