## Information to be attached for a P2P Medical Director Request

Dr. Wood asked me to remind the group to please include as much documentation as possible when sending him P2P requests. He does NOT have access to VUE360Rx; he is unable to see prior denials and/or subsequent upheld appeals. 

***Documentation should include the following:*** 

- name and DOB of member 
- provider name and phone number
- medical records (chart/progress notes, if available) 
- denial rationale (your note) 
- preferred medications (if applicable) 

Thank you.
