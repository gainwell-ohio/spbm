# Peer to Peer requests 7/24/23

Team,

@ Technician Supervisors – please cascade this information to your teams ASAP. Please also place in Evergreen where appropriate.

It has been brought to our attention from providers that there is some confusion surrounding peer to peer requests. I am working on updating the current P2P DLP to prevent any confusion, but in the meantime, please ensure that we are:

1.	If a peer to peer request is needed with a pharmacist, it is the responsibility of the pharmacist who decisioned the PA to take the peer to peer call (whether it be immediately, or a call back). If the pharmacist who decisioned the case is not available (OOO, at lunch, etc.), it is the responsibility of the pharmacist in the chat to take the peer to peer. We should **ALWAYS** be performing the peer to peer when it is ^^convenient for the prescriber/provider^^ and not at our convenience (whether this be immediately or a call back – whichever the prescriber/provider prefers). Pharmacists are then to document the peer to peer interaction on the internal tracker.
   
2.	A technician should ^^NEVER^^ refuse to allow the provider to perform a peer to peer. It is on the denial letter for every provider that they have the right to perform a peer to peer. We have been told that technicians are advising that we are “cracking down” on the amount of peer to peers we are allowing – this is NOT the case! 

Most of the time, the provider is wanting to provide additional information to support the PA request via peer to peer (they are not just calling to complain). This takes time for the provider to do. As pharmacists taking the peer to peer, it is our responsibility to actively listen to any additional information that is provided and make a determination based off of this additional information. 

As soon as the DLP is updated, I will pass it along to the supervisors to uptrain staff accordingly.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter!

### Information to be attached for a P2P Medical Director Request

Dr. Wood asked me to remind the group to please include as much documentation as possible when sending him P2P requests. He does NOT have access to VUE360Rx; he is unable to see prior denials and/or subsequent upheld appeals. 

***Documentation should include the following:*** 

- name and DOB of member 
- provider name and phone number
- medical records (chart/progress notes, if available) 
- denial rationale (your note) 
- preferred medications (if applicable) 

Thank you.
