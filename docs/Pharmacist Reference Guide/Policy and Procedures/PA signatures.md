## PA Signatures
NEVER cancel a PA for a missing signature

### Accept "signature" if the PA has atleast 1 of the following 3 elements:
1) Siganature
     - any marking on the line is acceptable, including typed signatures
2) Printed Name
3) Attestation Marked 
     

### Send the following PAs to "Med Review", using appropriate template and notes  
- The PA has ZERO of the above three elements

- The signature is obviously from a Pharmacist at the dispensing Pharmacy
    - Pharmacists CAN prescribe in Ohio and CAN submit Prior Authorizations. Only reject if it is obviously from a dispensing pharmacy, example: CVS
