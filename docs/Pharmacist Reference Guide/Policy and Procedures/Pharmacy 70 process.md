There have been some processing questions about when it is appropriate to be billed through the Ohio SPBM or the MCE for medical. As stated in the following rule that claims dispensed through pharmacy providers are billed to the SPBM. To accurately find out if a pharmacy is a pharmacy provider it can be found in Vue360RX by looking in the Provider tile and under the attributes section.

And listed under Ohio (MITS) PT Num/Desc will tell the provider type, the ones that we cover are the 70 as in this example![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122046056/230239863-fd108335-8cd2-4217-902d-40b60cb351ca.png)

So in this instance it is appropriate to bill through us. There are many situations where this may need to be checked like physician administered medications, IV home or center administration of medications, dispensing from a pharmacy but administered elsewhere other than home.
This can usually be found if looking at claims, the prior authorization sometimes gives the pharmacy, or if having a provider on the phone call to determine with look up by NPI or name/address. The gathering of this information can be done by either a technician or a pharmacist, and eventually when things can become more concrete can be handled by the initial PA entry by technicians.
 
For now in the event of processing a prior authorization that is not clearly defined how dispensed including the situations listed above and it is required to find out, it is appropriate at this time to reach out with the language below, where it is not truly a denial just a request for more information, please submit in the ADDITIONAL  chat for techs to fax back, eventually this will be a PA inquiry situation and hopefully caught when entering PA. 

***Please note this is not a denial - a prior authorization has been sent in for this member for this medication. If available, please provide the pharmacy name and NPI that is dispensing the medication or the NPI of the provider acquiring the product in a buy and bill situation. Per Rule 5160-26-13 | Managed health care programs: claim billing for pharmaceuticals., Claims for pharmaceuticals that are dispensed by pharmacy providers are billed through ODM's SPBM and for all other provider types, claims for pharmaceuticals are billed through an MCO, or in accordance with rule 5160-59-03 of the Administrative Code for individuals enrolled in the OhioRISE plan, as applicable.***

And when approving a medication that still may be slightly questionable it would be appropriate to inform them that even though it was approved through SPBM, under the current pharmacy provider information, that if the dispensing situation changes or if to be billed through some other means to inform them with this language. Please put this in the Approval Letter section when approving.
 

***This medication has been approved for processing and dispensing by a pharmacy provider as defined in Rule 5160-26-13. All other provider types claims for pharmaceuticals are billed through an MCO, or in accordance with rule 5160-59-03 of the Administrative Code for individuals enrolled in the OhioRISE plan***
 
 
I believe the techs eventually can do many of the 70 screening research but will still probably land on the pharmacists for now. Also if we get these medication requests also include all of the clinical appropriate questions required for approval with the pharmacy dispensing to lessen back and forth time.

Thanks, and please ask with any questions
