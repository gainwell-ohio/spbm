Hello,

There have been some processing questions about when it is appropriate
to be billed through the Ohio SPBM or the MCE for medical. As stated in
the following rule that claims dispensed through pharmacy providers are
billed to the SPBM. To accurately find out if a pharmacy is a pharmacy
provider it can be found in Vue360RX by looking in the Provider tile and
under the attributes section.

<span class="image"></span>

 

And listed under Ohio (MITS) PT Num/Desc will tell the provider type,
the ones that we cover are the 70 as in this example

 

<span class="image"></span>

 

So in this instance it is appropriate to bill through us. There are many
situations where this may need to be checked like physician administered
medications, IV home or center administration of medications, dispensing
from a pharmacy but administered elsewhere other than home.

This can usually be found if looking at claims, the prior authorization
sometimes gives the pharmacy, or if having a provider on the phone call
to determine with look up by NPI or name/address. The gathering of this
information can be done by either a technician or a pharmacist, and
eventually when things can become more concrete can be handled by the
initial PA entry by technicians.

 

For now in the event of processing a prior authorization that is not
clearly defined how dispensed including the situations listed above and
it is required to find out, it is appropriate at this time to reach out
with the language below, where it is not truly a denial just a request
for more information, please submit in the ADDITIONAL  chat for techs to
fax back, eventually this will be a PA inquiry situation and hopefully
caught when entering PA.

 

                                                                        

<span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Please note this is
not a denial - a prior authorization has been sent in for this member
for this medication. If available, please provide the pharmacy name and
NPI that is dispensing the medication or the NPI of the provider
acquiring the product in a buy and bill situation. Per Rule 5160-26-13 |
Managed health care programs: claim billing for pharmaceuticals., Claims
for pharmaceuticals that are dispensed by pharmacy providers are billed
through ODM's SPBM and for all other provider types, claims for
pharmaceuticals are billed through an MCO, or in accordance with rule
5160-59-03 of the Administrative Code for individuals enrolled in the
OhioRISE plan, as applicable.</span>

 

 

And when approving a medication that still may be slightly questionable
it would be appropriate to inform them that even though it was approved
through SPBM, under the current pharmacy provider information, that if
the dispensing situation changes or if to be billed through some other
means to inform them with this language. Please put this in the Approval
Letter section when approving.

 

<span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">This medication has
been approved for processing and dispensing by a pharmacy provider as
defined in Rule 5160-26-13. All other provider types claims for
pharmaceuticals are billed through an MCO, or in accordance with rule
5160-59-03 of the Administrative Code for individuals enrolled in the
OhioRISE plan</span>

 

 

I believe the techs eventually can do many of the 70 screening research
but will still probably land on the pharmacists for now. Also if we get
these medication requests also include all of the clinical appropriate
questions required for approval with the pharmacy dispensing to lessen
back and forth time.

Thanks, and please ask with any questions
