[Vacation Override Policy](https://mygainwell-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/christopher_nguyen_gainwelltechnologies_com/Documents/Evergreen/Emails/MUST%20READ_%20New%20Vacation%20Override%20Policy.msg?csf=1&web=1&e=VFpjmm){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

ODM changed the vacation override policy yesterday afternoon. It is as follows:

- All drugs: 3 months maximum override
- 1 override per medication per year
- No exceptions allowed
- If travel is in the USA, consideration should be made for in network pharmacies available to fill BEFORE providing overrides
- Must document: Leaving date, return date, travel location (city, state, country).
- Confirm ALL maintenance medications needed during the call (document the names of the medications, if they are only asking for 1 medication but there are more, ask about the additional drugs, ***it is not acceptable to say that they only asked for 1 drug- you need to ask***)
- Consider the quantity available/left on the prescription
 
***No more emailing ODM for approval. Technicians can approve this overrides themselves.***
 
This is effective immediately.
