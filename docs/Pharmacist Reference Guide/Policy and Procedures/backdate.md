Important!
Everyone Since we are incredibly busy in medreview now that we deny hundreds of more instead of cancelling, the permission has been given. ==**Technicians are now able to backdate to a year**==, do not post backdates in this chat. If there are rejections due to daily dose units, example is 7215, if it requires adjustment to achieve a claim and a PA was approved, you can update based on Cassandra's rounding guidance, and what is needed by using all your resources and update or put in a new PA. These are no longer requests to post here, do not post them. Thanks!
