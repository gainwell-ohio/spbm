# Backdating

**Technicians are now able to backdate up to a year**, do not post backdates in any chat.

If a **pharmacy** or the **provider** requests that you backdate a PA, you may backdate that PA up to one year if the member had active coverage on the date of service.

When building a new PA and the provider requests to backdate then you backdate to the date requested on the fax or verbally, if the member was active.

If there are rejections due to daily dose units, example is 7215, if it requires adjustment to achieve a claim and a PA was approved, you can update based on rounding guidance, and what is needed by using all your resources and update or put in a new PA.
