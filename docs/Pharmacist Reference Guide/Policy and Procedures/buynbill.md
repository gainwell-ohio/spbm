- 70 Pharmacy – We have decided update our current process on Evergreen. If you question a pharmacy situation ***(stated as buy and bill, no clear indication of the pharmacy)*** this is to be ^^denied^^ and sent the language starting with ^^“This is not a denial…..”^^ and if and hint of a pharmacy is given, please approve with the approval language provided. Please do not CANCEL any longer, it is DENY or APPROVE!
