General Practice

- 70 Pharmacy – We have decided update our current process on Evergreen. If you question a pharmacy situation ***(stated as buy and bill, no clear indication of the pharmacy)*** this is to be ^^denied^^ and sent the language starting with ^^“This is not a denial…..”^^ and if and hint of a pharmacy is given, please approve with the approval language provided. Please do not CANCEL any longer, it is DENY or APPROVE!

***Letter text:***

Please note this is not a denial - a prior authorization has been sent in for this member for this medication. If available, please provide the pharmacy name and NPI that is dispensing the medication or the NPI of the provider acquiring the product in a buy and bill situation. Per Rule 5160-26-13 | Managed health care programs: claim billing for pharmaceuticals., Claims for pharmaceuticals that are dispensed by pharmacy providers are billed through ODM's SPBM and for all other provider types, claims for pharmaceuticals are billed through an MCO, or in accordance with rule 5160-59-03 of the Administrative Code for individuals enrolled in the OhioRISE plan, as applicable.
