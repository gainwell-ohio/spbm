Good morning!

It has been brought up that there has been some confusion when cancelling cases vs. using the admin denial. I want to make sure that we are all on the same page moving forward. We have to ensure that the correct determination is being made so that the appropriate correspondence is going out.

***Admin denials are performed for “non-covered services” which include:***

-	***Drugs that are not payable/rebate***
-	***Obesity***
-	***Infertility***
-	***ED***
-	***DESI drugs***
-	***Drugs covered by Part D***
-	***Non-covered OTC’s (non-payable/non-rebate)***
-	***Off-label use of medication (off label indication, dosing, age, etc.)***

Under no circumstances should any of the above reasons result in cancellation of a case. 

Please reach out to Justin or I with any questions. 

Thank you,

Cassandra Roach, PharmD, RPh
