## Compound Approval Guide/Checklist (Pharmacist Use only)

- All Compound Medical Necessity requirements have been met.
- Pull up compound claim rejection and identify the reasons the claim is rejecting.
- Ensure the drug on PA # in PAWS matches the primary ingredient on the rejected claim.
    - No other compound ingredients will need to be entered as separate PA’s.

- Drug requested (primary ingredient) is entered at the GCNSeqNo level in PAWS.
- Ensure Effective Date is entered correctly.
    - Is the request for a backdate?
          i.	Look for requests to backdate under “Request Date”, Cover page, anywhere else on the PA form. Do NOT ASSUME it is the date we received the PA request.
          ii.	Note: Backdating prior to September will require a PA for most antibiotics that currently show NO PA required.

- Days supply = 365 days (Oncology requests) or 180 days (All other requests)
- Daily dose units = (Total Quantity dispensed on rejected claim ÷ days’ supply on rejected claim).
    - Round up the daily dose unit the nearest whole number.

- Hit the = twice to calculate the quantity approving
- Is the claim rejection ONLY rejecting for 7705D?
    - Approve the PA. No additional edit overrides are needed.
    
- Is the claim rejecting for 7230D (Cost exceeds – PA required) only? 
    - Approve the PA; AND 
    - Place the matching edit override with the same effective date, days supply, daily dose units and total quantity approved.

- Is the claim rejecting for any other edit other than 7705 or 7230 (firing with a “D”)?
    - Evaluate edits that are rejecting (Ex: quantity limits); AND 
    - Approve the submitted PA documentation (as some edits do not require PA) via the PA approval process (do not cancel, send back as not required or deny); AND
    - Place the matching edit override with the same effective date, days’ supply, daily dose units and total quantity approved.
