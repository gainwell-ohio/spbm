## Compound Approval Guide/Checklist (Pharmacist Use only)

- All Compound Medical Necessity requirements have been met.
- Pull up compound claim rejection and identify the reasons the claim is rejecting.
- Ensure the drug on PA # in PAWS matches the primary ingredient on the rejected claim.
    - No other compound ingredients will need to be entered as separate PA’s.

- Drug requested (primary ingredient) is entered at the GCNSeqNo level in PAWS.
- Ensure Effective Date is entered correctly.
    - Is the request for a backdate?
          i.	Look for requests to backdate under “Request Date”, Cover page, anywhere else on the PA form. Do NOT ASSUME it is the date we received the PA request.
          ii.	Note: Backdating prior to September will require a PA for most antibiotics that currently show NO PA required.

- Days supply = 365 days (Oncology requests) or 180 days (All other requests)
- Daily dose units = (Total Quantity dispensed on rejected claim ÷ days’ supply on rejected claim).
    - Round up the daily dose unit the nearest whole number.

- Hit the = twice to calculate the quantity approving
- Is the claim rejection ONLY rejecting for 7705D?
    - Approve the PA. No additional edit overrides are needed.
    
- Is the claim rejecting for 7230D (Cost exceeds – PA required) only? 
    - Approve the PA; AND 
    - Place the matching edit override with the same effective date, days supply, daily dose units and total quantity approved.

- Is the claim rejecting for any other edit other than 7705 or 7230 (firing with a “D”)?
    - Evaluate edits that are rejecting (Ex: quantity limits); AND 
    - Approve the submitted PA documentation (as some edits do not require PA) via the PA approval process (do not cancel, send back as not required or deny); AND
    - Place the matching edit override with the same effective date, days’ supply, daily dose units and total quantity approved.

## Additional Edits Overrides

•	The IV medications that are stating to have restrictions lifted will still have ***certain edits applied to them like cost.*** It is understood that many of the IV medications that had restrictions lifted shouldn’t hit many of these, but be aware that there may still be some edits that do happen.

## No PA required on specific Compounds 7/28/23

If below ingredients are the primary ingredient in the compound, they should no longer be hitting for PA required (most likely will not be until next week or the following that they will no longer reject for PA needed). **Until these ingredients are loaded in the system, please ^^approve^^ the below ingredients on compound requests.**
