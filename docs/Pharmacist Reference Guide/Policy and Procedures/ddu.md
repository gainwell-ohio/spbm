# Daily Dose units Processing

11/8/2023

Team –

Moving forward, when reviewing a PA, please round up the calculated daily dose unit to the nearest whole number. After rounding up, remove the calculated “Quantity Dispensed” and hit the = sign to get the new calculated Quantity Dispensed.

Daily Dose Unit Examples:

- 0.001 = round up to 1
- 0.05 = round up to 1
- 0.2 = round up to 1
- 5.6 = round up to 6
- 13.25 = round up to 14

Thank you,

Everyone This seems to be a common question, quantity limits vs rounding up, quantity limits are king, we do not surpass these unless that is the focus of the PA. everything 7026 when it gets turned on, they put those in specifically to control qty. The rounding up, that is only for those that don't have qty limits, more for the continuous issues we have with immunomodulators and IV medications
