# Daily Dose units Processing

11/8/2023

Team –

Moving forward, when reviewing a PA, please round up the calculated daily dose unit to the nearest whole number. After rounding up, remove the calculated “Quantity Dispensed” and hit the = sign to get the new calculated Quantity Dispensed.

Daily Dose Unit Examples:

- 0.001 = round up to 1
- 0.05 = round up to 1
- 0.2 = round up to 1
- 5.6 = round up to 6
- 13.25 = round up to 14

Thank you,
