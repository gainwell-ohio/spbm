# Duplicate PA Procedures 8/10/23

Team,

ODM is externally reviewing our cancellations on a daily basis as a large amount of PAâ€™s that come in are being cancelled. Per ODM direction, moving forward, we are ==NOT to cancel a case as a duplicate request== for a member ^^UNLESS^^ it comes in on the ==same date with the same information.== Ex: If we receive a case on 8/8 (we denied) and then again on 8/9 with the same information, we are to review and then deny (not send back as a cancellation). Ex: If we receive a case on 8/8 (we denied) and then another case on 8/8 comes in with the same exact information, we can cancel with fax back.

Thank you,

Cassandra Roach, PharmD, RPh
