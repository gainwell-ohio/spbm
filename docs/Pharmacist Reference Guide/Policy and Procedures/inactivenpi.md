# Inactive Prescriber NPI

9/21/23

Will post in teams also. Here for visibility. From Cassandra:

“Please make sure that we are **never cancelling for an inactive NPI**. Please let the teams know this. This edit is set to WARN and not to DENY as the system information that we have may show the prescriber is termed, but they really aren't. I will send out a screenshot guide, but if a PA is manually entered, it will tell you the NPI cannot be found if you type it in. You have to go down and select the rejected claim and the provider will populate. I am working with product team and PNM about the files.”

If you scroll down to denied claim history, and if there are denied claims there, clicking on the asterisk (*) will populate the prescriber info. As stated, there will be a screenshot guide forthcoming.
