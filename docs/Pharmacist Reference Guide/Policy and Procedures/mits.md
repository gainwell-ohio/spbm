Additionally, below you will find a list of questions that could help the Service Desk in expediting the processing of tickets that are created by the Call center supervisors.  With this information included in the ticket, it could help streamline the process so the Service Desk can quickly review, and get the incident in front of the needed resources and escalate when needed.  Not all will be pertinent to the issue at hand, but with enough information obtained on the front end, it will help us in triaging urgency and impact without having to return and ask for additional information.
