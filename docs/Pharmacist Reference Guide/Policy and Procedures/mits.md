## Directions for submission of MITS tickets 5/23/23

1.	Report the issue your immediate supervisor/supervisor on duty via Teams chat (tech supervisors/leads are available 24/7). Please provide as much detail as possible surrounding your issue (when it started, VPN you are using, browser you are using, etc.). If you do not report anything, we assume that your system is working correctly for you.

- Pharmacists â€“ please outreach Justin, Rachel or myself. If we happen to not be available via Teams chat, after 11pm, please place the ticket yourself (use below instructions).
- The supervisor will need to be the one to determine if this is an isolated issue, or potentially widespread prior to submitting the ticket (we need as much information as possible to submit these).

2.	Once the supervisor/lead has gathered all of the pertinent information to be submitted, please follow these instructions below:
-	Submit the ticket to OH_MITS_Service_Desk: ohio_mits_servicedesk_group@gainwelltechnologies.com
-	CC the following individuals: Aaron Banks, Cassandra Roach, Denise Olusula, OH SPBM PA Pharmacist, OH Supervisors and Sr. Techs, Dan Gonos, Chad Rogers, Angie Stevens and Melissa Rutledge.
-	If the email contains any PHI, please send encrypted!
-	Include as much information as possible so that the service desk has everything they need to know
   -	 Ex: Specific VPN, browser used (Chrome Vs. Edge), how many users impacted, etc. 

Thank you,

Cassandra Roach, PharmD, RPh

Additionally, below you will find a list of questions that could help the Service Desk in expediting the processing of tickets that are created by the Call center supervisors.  With this information included in the ticket, it could help streamline the process so the Service Desk can quickly review, and get the incident in front of the needed resources and escalate when needed.  Not all will be pertinent to the issue at hand, but with enough information obtained on the front end, it will help us in triaging urgency and impact without having to return and ask for additional information.
