| OCC 1:  A pharmacy would use Other Coverage Code (OCC 1) when the primary coverage on file for the patient is no longer active. Code used when ODM has TPL on file, but the pharmacy has made a good faith effort to verify it and has determined it is INACTIVE. | Process |

| In this instance, Ohio Medicaid will only coverage the claim if it is an Ohio Medicaid covered drug AND the primary plan rejects with one of the following rejects: ==A5, MR, 65-69 (eligibility rejects), 70== | PA should be reviewed:
| Dual eligible: Medicare + Medicaid: Review Website: ***Covered for Dual Eligible=YES*** | **Review PA** |
| Dual eligible: Medicare + Medicaid: Review Website: ***Covered for Dual Eligible=NO*** ** | **ADMIN DENY** |

**Drugs that are covered or are eligible to be covered by Medicare Part D, when prescribed for an individual who is eligible for Medicare. </br>

**NOTE:** If the rejection code is NOT one of the above codes, it will reject as ==NCPDP Reject code: 6E – M/I Other Payer Reject Code and the pharmacy would need to reach out to the primary payer for resolution==.

| ----------- | ----- |
| This typically happens because the member has a deductible to meet before the primary insurance will pay the claim. Primary covers medications | **Approve automatically (Exception non-covered services: Obesity, ED)** |
