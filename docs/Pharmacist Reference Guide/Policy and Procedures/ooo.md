# Out of Office 6/22/23

Hello Team!  Wanted to send out some instructions to follow when scheduling time off.

1. If you are going to be OOO for any vacation days outside the company Holidays, please make sure to do the following 3 steps:

    a. ^^Enter time off^^ in Mygainwell@work (SAP Success Factor) using the Time Off widget.

    b. ^^Send an OOO calendar notice to your team^^ (people who need to know you are going to be out).  You can do this by following these steps:

      - Go to Outlook calendar and select New Meeting (NOT a TEAMS meeting)
      - Title:  OOO-vacation-name
      - Enter your team mates on the “required attendee” line
      - Select Start and End dates and check the “All Day” box
      - Can enter Location as OOO or vacation or whatever you want.
      - **On the top bar, make sure the Show As says FREE.  Change the reminder to NONE.  Hit the Response Options and uncheck REQUEST RESPONSES** (or else you will be getting a lot of e-mail as people accept or decline the OOO notice).
      - Put an OOO message in the body with back-ups or emergency contact information.
      - Once you have sent, you can go back into it on your calendar, set the SHOW AS to OOO (purple).  Then hit the x on the top right corner to exit.  **A box will appear where you can select “Save but don’t send”.**  This will purple out the days on your calendar but not send a purple-out to the team members you sent it to.
  
    c.	Before you leave the office, ^^go to Outlook calendar>File>Automatic Replies (Out of Office) and set your out of office response message and date/time.^^  This will make sure anyone who tries to e-mail you while you are out will get a notice that you are out and who they should contact in your absence.

2.	For partial day OOO notices you can follow above steps and enter the Start and End times for the block you will be out (2 hours, 4 hours, etc.).  ***However, only send these to the leader and teammates that absolutely need to know you are out for a few hours since this will produce a block on their calendars.***

3.	When receiving an OOO notice from someone you can choose to DECLINE so it does not populate on your calendar.  This does not mean you are “declining their time off”.  I recommend accepting OOO notifications for those who are direct reports to you or are on your team and you need to know they are OOO.
