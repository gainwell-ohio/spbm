# PA Trial Lookback period 7/5/23

Team,

As you all are aware, preferred trials needed per PA criteria must be confirmed by paid pharmacy claims. I was able to verify with ODM on Monday the expectation for lookbacks in claims for trials. 

Technician supervisors, Training team, Quality team and Pharmacist supervisors – Please distribute and communicate this directive to your teams as this will be the standard moving forward when reviewing PA’s as of 7/5/2023. Please also ensure that it is posted to Evergreen for all pharmacists and technicians to reference.

***PA Criteria trials***

1.	Trials MUST be confirmed by paid pharmacy claims.

 - Lookback period for trials in paid pharmacy claims is ^^1 year lookback period (for both pharmacists and technicians), unless chart notes /first page of PA form under “Pertinent past or present therapies” indicate that the trial occurred prior to the 1 year lookback.^^ In this instance, it is appropriate to look back further in claims to verify that these trials occurred. Please ensure that we continue to document dates of paid pharmacy claims trials in our internal notes.
 - If the member was not eligible with us at the time of trial dates listed on the PA (must have specific trial dates to confirm trial duration – cannot just say 2020), or are new to OH MCD, it is acceptable to approve based off of these trials. Please note specific trial dates as month/day/year on your internal notes.

Please let me know if there’s any questions!

Thank you,

Cassandra Roach, PharmD, RPh

# PA Re-authorization Lookback Period 10/31/23

Good morning, Team!

There was a question brought to the Manager meeting last week surrounding re-authorizations and what to do if the member has a previous authorization (now expired), but no recent paid claims. Per ODM: 

- If the medication was previously approved, but no paid claims for the medication in the last year, treat as an initial authorization request and use initial criteria. If paid claims in the last year, treat as reauthorization and follow reauthorization criteria.
    - ***Exception:*** If the drug is a **PRN drug**, there may not be claims within the last year. In these instances, ^^look in entire profile for previous paid claims^^. If no paid claims, treat as initial authorization if paid claims, treat as reauthorization.

We also need to ensure that ==both technicians and pharmacists are looking for trials within the entire member claims history (not just the last year) for paid claims==. If member has previous paid claims for trials, document dates of trials in internal notes section and accept these.

Thank you, 

Cassandra Roach, PharmD, RPh
