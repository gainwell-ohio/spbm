# PA Trial Lookback period 

## General Claims Lookback Period 11/8/2023

^^General Claims Lookback Period^^

How far back can we look for relevant claims in a PA determination? 

- Previously we were able to look back 1 year in claims for anything not added to the "past and pertinent therapies" section of the PA
- **NOW - we will review a member's profile and look at ==ALL== relevant claims, ^^not just limited to one year^^**


## PA Re-authorization Lookback Period 10/31/23

Good morning, Team!

There was a question brought to the Manager meeting last week surrounding re-authorizations and what to do if the member has a previous authorization (now expired), but no recent paid claims. Per ODM: 

- If the medication was previously approved, but no paid claims for the medication in the last year, treat as an initial authorization request and use initial criteria. If paid claims in the last year, treat as reauthorization and follow reauthorization criteria.
    - ***Exception:*** If the drug is a **PRN drug**, there may not be claims within the last year. In these instances, ^^look in entire profile for previous paid claims^^. If no paid claims, treat as initial authorization if paid claims, treat as reauthorization.

We also need to ensure that ==both technicians and pharmacists are looking for trials within the entire member claims history (not just the last year) for paid claims==. If member has previous paid claims for trials, document dates of trials in internal notes section and accept these.

Thank you,

## Trials outside claims history lookback 7/5/2023

If the member was not eligible with us at the time of trial dates listed on the PA (must have specific trial dates to confirm trial duration â€“ cannot just say 2020), or are new to OH MCD, it is acceptable to approve based off of these trials. Please note specific trial dates on your internal notes.

Thank you,
