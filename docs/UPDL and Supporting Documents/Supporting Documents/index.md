The Statewide PDL is not an all-inclusive list of drugs covered by Ohio Department of Medicaid.

Medications that are new to market will be non-preferred until reviewed by Ohio Department of Medicaid's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee.

The list is set up in sections defined by therapeutic class. Products are listed by generic name if the generic is available. In most cases, a brand-name drug for which a generic product is available will be nonpreferred. Some medications may require a specific manufacturer or the brand to be dispensed

Ohio Department of Medicaid will not cover medications not part of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program unless indicated.

Grandfathered categories will be denoted with a \* next to their title on the table of contents
