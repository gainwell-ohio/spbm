## Scope / Requirements

Medical necessity is a cornerstone to affording quality care to members. 
In accordance with Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rule 5160-1-01, Gainwell assures applicable utilization management 
decisions meet the definitions and conditions of medical necessity. OAC rule 5160-1-01 indicates

Conditions of medical necessity for a procedure, item, or service are met if all the following apply:

1. It meets generally accepted standards of medical practice;
2. It is clinically appropriate in its type, frequency, extent, duration, and delivery setting;
3. It is appropriate to the health condition for which it is provided and is expected to produce desired outcome;
4. It is the lowest cost alternative that effectively addresses and treats the medical problem; 
5. It provides unique, essential, and appropriate information if it is used for diagnostic purposes; and
6. It is not provided primarily for the economic benefit of the provider nor the sole convenience of the provider or anyone else other than the patient.

### Purpose

This document describes how medical necessity decisions are made. Medical necessity decisions are 
supported using multiple sources and are regularly reviewed for consistent applicability. Clinical criteria 
sets provide the foundational decision support tool to determine medical necessity. Clinical criteria sets 
are built, in collaboration with the ODM and stakeholders, based on clinical practice guidelines. Medical 
necessity decisions are also supported by nationally recognized compendia, clinical literature, peer-reviewed journals, 
leading medical associations, and other relevant sources, and will be cited as part of the decision documentation. 
A prioritization of clinical insights will be evaluated in the following rank order:

1. Systematic Reviews
2. Randomized Controlled Trials
3. Cohort Studies
4. Case-Control Studies
5. Case Series/Case Reports
6. Expert Opinion

### Procedures

#### Products without Criteria

Gainwell will approve the use of products without criteria, defined as products not listed on the Unified 
Preferred Drug List (UPDL), Additional Therapeutic Classes with Clinical Criteria, Preferred Diabetic 
Supply List, Over-The-Counter List or any other applicable Ohio Department of Medicaid published list,
and consider their use as medically necessary when the following criteria have been met for situations as 
listed below. Drug-specific criteria developed and approved by the P&T (Pharmacy & Therapeutics) 
Committee and drug, or therapeutic category benefit exclusions will take precedent to the below criteria.

^^Initial Criteria^^ (Please Note: Oncology agents only require 1, 2, and 3 to be fulfilled for initial authorization)

1. In accordance with the drug's package insert, the requested medication meets **ALL** of the following:
   
    - For FDA-approved indication
        - FDA-approved age
        - FDA-approved dosing
        - Baseline safety requirements (which include but are not limited to labs, diagnostic screenings, etc.) per the package insert and REMS program (if applicable)
        - Member does not have any contraindication; **and**
    - For non-FDA-approved indication
        - Please see Off-Label section below

2. Chart notes along with any relevant screening results are provided to confirm the diagnosis; **and**
3. The requested medication is being prescribed by or in consultation with an appropriate specialist, 
when applicable (e.g., a product without criteria from the same class that requires a specialist in 
the specific prior authorization criteria); **and**
4. Documentation has provided supporting one of the following:
   
   - Adequate trial and failure or intolerance of THREE preferred products with criteria in the same drug class that can be used for the same diagnosis (if applicable);
        - Adequate trial and failure would be defined as a thirty (30) day trial (if applicable) with each of the three preferred products that can be used to treat the member’s 
        condition; **or**
   - If there is no alternative in the same drug class, must have adequate trial and failure or 
    intolerance of TWO preferred products with criteria alternatives, if available, that can be 
    used for the requested indication according to clinical guidelines or standard of care; **or**
   - Member has contraindication to ALL other products with criteria based on the member’s 
    diagnosis, medical conditions, or other medication therapies; **or**
   - There are no other preferred medications available to treat member condition (e.g., orphan 
    drug) or requested dosage forms; **and** prescriber has provided appropriate supporting
    clinical evidence for member’s need of the non-preferred drug.

5. If the requested medication is a combination product, the member has also tried a ninety (90) 
daytrial of the active ingredients separately taken at the same time AND a clinical reason 
supported by chart notes why the separate agents cannot be used (request for the purpose of 
convenience does not meet medical necessity); **and**
 
6. If the requested medication is a long-acting product, the member has also tried a ninety (90) day 
of a short-acting product OR have a clinical reason why the short-acting product cannot be used
(if appropriate for diagnosis).

1. Documentation has been provided showing that member’s clinical response to treatment and 
ongoing safety monitoring; **and**
2. The requested use and dosage remain consistent with FDA-approved prescribing information in 
the drug’s package insert.

#### Off-Label

^^Oncology Drugs^^

Request for off-label uses of a cancer drug will be considered for approval if they meet the below requirements:

1. The drug is FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved; **and**
2. The prescription drug is recognized for treatment of the indication in **^^one^^** of the following:

    - National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Drug and Biologics Compendium Category of Evidence and Consensus 1 or 2a or
    - Evidence from at least two published studies from major scientific or medical peer 
    reviewed journals demonstrates safety and efficacy for the specified condition in a 
    comparable population (e.g., age group, level of disease severity, etc.)
        - If applicable clinical trial is yet to be published but interim results are supportive, 
        this may be taken into consideration by the clinician reviewer.

^^Non-Oncology Drugs^^

Requests for off-label use of a non-cancer drug will be considered for approval if they meet all the following criteria:

1. The drug is approved by the FDA; **and**
2. Documentation must be submitted showing the member has tried and failed the existing FDA approved and/or 
clinical guideline recommended therapies unless contraindicated or not tolerated; **and**
3. The prescribed use must be supported by one or more of the following:

    - Lexicomp: Evidence level A; **or**
    - Evidence from at least two published studies from major scientific or medical peer 
    reviewed journals demonstrates safety and efficacy for the specified condition in a 
    comparable population (e.g., age group, level of disease severity, etc.)
        - If applicable clinical trial is yet to be published but interim results are supportive, this 
        may be taken into consideration by the clinician reviewer.

#### Orphan Drug Use

Use of an orphan drug is considered medically necessary when it receives FDA Orphan Drug designation 
and marketing approval. A product may have an orphan drug designation but fail to meet the criteria to 
have FDA marketing approval. Use of a product with orphan drug designation alone without FDA 
marketing approval is considered not medically necessary.

1. Member had a trial and failure with both of the following:

    - Two generic manufacturers (if available) of the requested brand name medication 
    (information must be provided on the adverse event that was experienced by the member 
    for each generic manufacturer) **or**

2. The member had a serious adverse event with the generic version(s) and the prescriber has 
provided a copy and confirmation of a MedWatch form submission to the FDA documenting the 
adverse outcome experienced by the member that includes one of the following (Note: The

#### EPSDT

Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Services 

EPSDT is a child health program in Medicaid. It is designed to meet the physical, mental, and 
developmental health needs of children. The purpose of EPSDT is to find and treat health problems early
so that children can have the best health and development possible. In Ohio, the EPSDT program is 
called Healthchek.

Any child younger than age 21 who has Medicaid is covered by Healthchek/EPSDT. Children who are 
covered by a Medicaid waiver, children who have a Medicaid card, and children who are in a Medicaid 
managed care plan are all eligible for Healthchek/EPSDT. Medicaid-eligible children are automatically 
eligible for Healthchek/EPSDT. No separate enrollment is necessary.

Determination of whether a service is medically-necessary for an individual child must be made on a 
case-by-case basis taking into account the particular needs of the child.

According to OAC rule 5160-1-01,

1. Medical necessity for individuals covered by early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and 
treatment (EPSDT) is criteria of coverage for procedures, items, or services that prevent, 
diagnose, evaluate, correct, ameliorate, or treat an adverse health condition such as an illness, 
injury, disease, or its symptoms, emotional or behavioral dysfunction, intellectual deficit, cognitive 
impairment, or developmental disability.

2. Medical necessity for individuals not covered by EPSDT is criteria of coverage for procedures, 
items, or services that prevent, diagnose, evaluate, or treat an adverse health condition such as 
an illness, injury, disease or its symptoms, emotional or behavioral dysfunction, intellectual deficit, 
cognitive impairment, or developmental disability and without which the person can be expected 
to suffer prolonged, increased or new morbidity; impairment of function; dysfunction of a body 
organ or part; or significant pain and discomfort.

3. Conditions of medical necessity for a procedure, item, or service are met if all the following apply:
    1. It meets generally accepted standards of medical practice;
    2. It is clinically appropriate in its type, frequency, extent, duration, and delivery setting;
    3. It is appropriate to the adverse health condition for which it is provided and is expected to 
produce the desired outcome;
    4. It is the lowest cost alternative that effectively addresses and treats the medical problem;
    5. It provides unique, essential, and appropriate information if it is used for diagnostic 
purposes; and
    6. It is not provided primarily for the economic benefit of the provider nor for the sole 
convenience of the provider or anyone else other than the recipient.

4. The fact that a physician, dentist, or other licensed practitioner renders, prescribes, orders, 
certifies, recommends, approves, or submits a claim for a procedure, item, or service does not, in 
and of itself make the procedure, item, or service medically necessary and does not guarantee 
payment.

5. The definition and conditions of medical necessity articulated in this rule apply throughout the 
entire Medicaid program. More specific criteria regarding the conditions of medical necessity for 
categories of service may be set forth within the Ohio department of Medicaid (ODM) coverage 
policies or rules.

#### Gender Dysphoria

If the member is less than 21 years of age, the request will be reviewed under Medical Necessity based 
on the EPSDT section noted above.

If the member is 21 years of age or older, the request will be reviewed using the following:

^^Initial Criteria^^

1. The drug is FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved; **and**
