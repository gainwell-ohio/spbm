## Scope / Requirements

Medical necessity is a cornerstone to affording quality care to members. In accordance with Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rule 5160-1-01, Gainwell assures applicable utilization management decisions meet the definitions and conditions of medical necessity.

Conditions of medical necessity for a procedure, item, or service are met if all the following apply:

1. It meets generally accepted standards of medical practice;
2. It is clinically appropriate in its type, frequency, extent, duration, and delivery setting;
3. It is appropriate to the health condition for which it is provided and is expected to produce desired outcome;
4. It is the lowest cost alternative that effectively addresses and treats the medical problem; **and**
5. It is not provided primarily for the economic benefit of the provider nor the sole convenience of the provider or anyone else other than the patient.

### Purpose

This document describes how medical necessity decisions are made. Medical necessity decisions are supported using multiple sources and are regularly reviewed for consistent applicability. Clinical criteria sets provide the foundational decision support tool to determine medical necessity. Clinical criteria sets are built, in collaboration with the ODM and stakeholders, based on clinical practice guidelines. Medical necessity decisions are also supported by nationally recognized compendia, clinical literature, peer-reviewed journals, leading medical associations, and other relevant sources, and will be cited as part of the decision documentation.

### Procedures

#### Non-Unified Preferred Drug List Medications

Gainwell will approve the use of non-UPDL medications and consider their use as medically necessary when the following criteria have been met for situations as listed below. Drug-specific criteria developed and approved by the P&T (Pharmacy & Therapeutics) Committee, DUR (Drug Utilization Review) Board Committee, and ODM, or therapeutic category benefit exclusions will take precedent to the below criteria. 

**Initial Criteria** - Approval length will be decided based on the members disease, condition, and the medication

1. In accordance with the drug's package insert, the requested medication meets **ALL** of the following:
   
   - FDA-approved indication and age;
   - FDA-approved dosage;
   - Member does not have any contraindication; **and**

2. Chart notes along with any relevant screening results are provided to confirm the diagnosis; **and**
3. The requested medication is being prescribed by or in consultation with an appropriate specialist, when applicable (e.g., a formulary product from the same class requires a specialist in its specific prior authorization criteria); **and**
4. Documentation has provided supporting one of the following:
   
   - Adequate trial and failure or intolerance of ALL formulary alternatives in the same drug class that can be used for the same diagnosis; **or**
   - If there is no alternative in the same drug class, must have adequate trial and failure or intolerance of TWO formulary alternatives, if available, that can be used for the requested indication according to clinical guidelines or standard of care; **or**
   - Member has contraindication to ALL other formulary medications based on the member's diagnosis, medical conditions, or other medication therapies; **or** 
   - There are no other medications available on the formulary to treat member condition (e.g., orphan drug); **or**
   - Clinical reason why the member should receive this medication without trialing others; **and**

5. If the requested medication is a combination product, the member has also tried a ninety (90) day trial of the active ingredients separately taken at the same time AND a clinical reason supported by chart notes why the separate agents cannot be used (request for the purpose of convenience does not meet medical necessity); **and**
6. If the requested medication is a long-acting product, the member has also tried a ninety (90) day of a short-acting product OR have a clinical reason why the short-acting product cannot be used.

**Renewal Criteria** - Approval length will be decided based on the members disease, condition, how the patient has responded, and the medication

1. Chart notes have been provided showing that member has had a positive response to therapy **and**
2. The requested use and dosage remain consistent with FDA-approved prescribing information in the drug's package insert.

1. The drug is FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved; **and**
2. The prescription drug is recognized for treatment of the indication in one of the following:

    - National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Drug and Biologics Compendium Category of Evidence and Consensus 1 or 2a or
    - In two substantially accepted peer-reviewed medical literature sources.

**Non-Cancer Drugs**

Requests for off-label use of a non-cancer drug will be considered for approval if they meet all the following criteria:

#### Orphan Drug Use

Use of an orphan drug is considered medically necessary when it receives FDA Orphan Drug designation and marketing approval.

4. If any ingredient in the compound, active or inactive, otherwise requires prior authorization, the member must meet criteria established for medical necessity for that ingredient **and**
