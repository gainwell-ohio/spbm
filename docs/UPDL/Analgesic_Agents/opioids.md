  - Trialed and failed non-pharmacologic treatments and/or non-opioid analgesics ineffective or contraindicated

  - Diagnosis code must be submitted and should be for somatic type pain

  - Benefits and risks of opioid therapy have been discussed with patient (attestation documented on prior authorization form)
  
  - Prescriber has checked OARRS (attestation documented on prior authorization form)

Length of authorization: Up to 90 days, depending on the indication, previous patient utilization, and requested length of therapy (could be more restrictive)

  - ≥ 30 mg oral oxycodone/day, or
  - ≥ 8 mg oral hydromorphone/day, or
  - ≥ 25 mg oral oxymorphone/day, or
  - Equianalgesic dose of another opioid; and

- Dose is <*/*= 4 units per day

## All Long-Acting Opioids Require Prior Authorization

Initial request (90-day approval)

- Catastrophic injury or cancer pain does not require additional documentation (documentation should be provided as part of prior authorization form)
- All other causes of pain:

  - Documented treatment plan including risk assessment, substance abuse history, concurrent therapies
  - OARRS checked within 7 days prior to initiating long-acting therapy
  - Documentation of pain and function scores at each visit
  - Baseline urine drug test submitted and treatment plan includes requirements for random urine screens
  - Opioid contract required to be in place and should be submitted with prior authorization form
  - Documented failure of both non-opioid pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments
  - History of short-acting opioids for \>/= 60 days
  - Daily Dose <*/*= 80 MED

- Renewal requests (after initial 90 days then every 180 days)
  - Current treatment plan
  - Demonstrated adherence to treatment plan through progress notes including pain and function scores and random urine screens results reviewed and concerns addressed, no serious adverse outcomes observed

- Dose escalation requests
  - Prescriber indicates escalation of dose is likely to result in improved function and pain control
  - Daily Dose \>100 MED requires pain specialist or anesthesiologist consultation
