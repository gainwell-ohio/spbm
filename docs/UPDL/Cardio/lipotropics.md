# Cardiovascular Agents: Lipotropics

## LENGTH OF AUTHORIZATIONS

365 days all Lipotropics

| **Trial period**             | 30 days for HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors, Niacin derivatives, ezetimibe  (Zetia), 90 days for Fibrates, and 84 days for ATP Citrate Lyase (ACL) Inhibitors                             |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Number of non-PA agents**  | 1 medication – The assumption is that the medication must be in the same class of the medication requested, if available, except for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors- see specific criteria  |

## PRIOR AUTHORIZATION CRITERIA

- Is there any reason the patient cannot be changed to a medication not requiring prior approval?

    Acceptable reasons include:

  - Allergy to medications not requiring prior approval
  - Contraindication to or drug-to-drug interaction with medications not requiring prior approval (pravastatin is the **only** HMG-CoA not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 liver enzyme system)
  - History of unacceptable/toxic side effects to medications not requiring prior approval

## ADDITIONAL PRIOR AUTHORIZATION CRITERIA

- If there has been a 30-day trial with no less than **two** of preferred HMG-CoA products, then a nonpreferred HMG-CoA agent can be approved.

## ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR COLESEVELAM (WELCHOL)

- Colesevelam may be approved as first-line therapy if there is a diagnosis of diabetes

- Will be approved through systematic PA if there is a history of an oral hypoglycemic or insulin in the previous 120 days

## ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR PCSK9 INHIBITORS

- For Repatha: Age ≥18 years with ASCVD or Age ≥10 years and Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) **OR** for Praluent: Age ≥18 years with ASCVD or FH

  **AND**

- Documented adherence to prescribed lipid lowering medications for previous 90 days

Baseline lab results are required, and approvals will be for 365 days. Subsequent approvals will require additional levels being done to assess changes.

Diagnosis of Familial Hypercholesterolemia (includes Heterozygous [HeFH] and Homozygous [HoFH]) **AND** must meet all:

1. Unable to reach goal LDL-C (LDL ≤ 100mg/dL for adults or LDL ≤ 110mg/dL for those \< 18 years of age) with maximally tolerated dose of statin and ezetimibe (Zetia)
    - A trial of 2 or more high potency statins (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin)

Diagnosis of Clinical Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) **AND** must meet both:

1. History of MI, angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA or PVD or atherosclerotic origin and
2. Unable to reach goal LDL-C (LDL ≤ 70mg/dL) with maximally tolerated dose of statin and ezetimibe (Zetia)
    - A trial of 2 or more high potency statins (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin)

## ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR ATP Citrate Lyase (ACL) Inhibitor

All products in this class require clinical prior authorization:

- Age ≥18 years

- A trial and failure with one PCSK9 inhibitor

- Unable to reach goal LDL-C after a trial of 2 or more statins (one must be atorvastatin) at the maximally tolerated dose
  - Nexlizet (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe tablet) approval requires one of the previous statin trials to be in combination with ezetimibe (Zetia)
  - Documented adherence to prescribed lipid lowering medications for previous 90 days
  - Baseline lab results are required, and approvals will belimited to 84 days initially and then annually thereafter. Subsequent approvals will require additional levels being done to assess changes
  - Lipid profile required at 56 days for HeFH or ASCVD
