# Infectious Disease Agents: Antivirals – Hepatitis C Agents

**LENGTH OF AUTHORIZATIONS:**  365 days except simeprevir and direct acting antivirals (DAAs), see below

 **PRIOR AUTHORIZATION CRITERIA:**

Is there any reason the patient cannot be changed to a medication within the same class that does not require prior approval?

Acceptable reasons include:

- Allergy to medications not requiring prior approval

- Contraindication to or drug interaction with medications not requiring prior approval

- History of unacceptable/toxic side effects to medications not requiring prior approval

- Patients established on current therapy with prior payer (i.e. Commercial, Fee-for- Service, Managed Care Plan, etc).

**ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR DAAs:**

All HCV DAAs require clinical prior authorization. Only regimens recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) will be approved.

Please see the [Hepatitis C Direct Acting Antiviral Prior Authorization Form](https://pharmacy.medicaid.ohio.gov/sites/default/files/HepC_PA_Form_20211119.pdf#overlay-context=prior-authorization) for criteria and the most recent regimens recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO AID IN THE FINAL DECISION:**

- Pegylated Interferons have a Black Box Warning which indicates that a patient should be monitored closely with periodic clinical and laboratory evaluations.

- Ribavirins are contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in their male partner(s). At least two reliable forms of contraception must be used during therapy.
