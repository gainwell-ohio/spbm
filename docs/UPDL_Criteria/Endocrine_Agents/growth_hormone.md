Reauthorization: The patient health status has improved since last approval (weight gain, improved body composition) 1-year approval

Adults - initial approval for 180 days:

Adult patients with growth hormone deficiency may be approved for replacement of endogenous growth hormone upon documentation of medical necessity from an endocrinologist. Requests will be

reviewed and approved based upon the following conditions:

1.  Childhood Onset - Patients who were growth hormone deficient during childhood and who have a continued deficiency which is confirmed by provocative testing.
    1.  Adult Onset - Patients who have growth hormone deficiency, either alone or with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, such as hypopituitarism, as a result of pituitary disease, surgery, hypothalamic disease, radiation therapy, or trauma.

        Criteria for Approval for both conditions listed above:

        1.  Biochemical diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency by means of a negative response to an appropriate stimulation test ordered by the endocrinologist

            (Clonidine test is not acceptable for adults.); AND

        2.  No evidence of malignancy or other contraindication; AND
        3.  Other hormonal deficiencies addressed with adequate replacement therapy; AND
        4.  Base-line evaluation of the following clinical indicators

            a. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-also required following dosage change b. Fasting lipid profile

            1.  BUN
                1.  Fasting glucose
                2.  Electrolyte levels
                3.  Evaluation of any new osteoarthritis and joint pain
                4.  Bone density test

                    Maximum dose – less than or equal to 0.025mg/kg daily (up 35 years of age)

                    Maximum dose – less than or equal to 0.0125mg/kg daily (35 years of age or older) Reauthorization: documentation by endocrinologist that for the indication,

                    discontinuing GH would have a detrimental effect on body composition or other metabolic parameters 1-year approval
