    Acceptable reasons include:

    - Allergy to medications not requiring prior approval

    - Contraindication to or drug-to-drug interaction with medications not requiring prior approval: Drug interactions (inhibition of CYP450 system) Ketoconazole \> Itraconazole\> Voriconazole \>Fluconazole

    - History of unacceptable/toxic side effects to medications not requiring prior approval

2. If the patient has a serious illness that causes them to be immunocompromised [i.e. AIDS, cancer, organ (solid or non-solid) transplant] then may approve the requested medication.
3. If there have been therapeutic failures to no less than a **7-day** trial of at least **one** medication not requiring prior approval, then may approve the requested medication.

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO AID IN THE FINAL DECISION:**

1. If the patient is completing a course of therapy with a medication requiring prior approval, which was initiated in the hospital or other similar location, or if the patient has just become Medicaid eligible and is already on a course of treatment with a medication requiring prior approval, then may approve the requested medication.
2. If the request is for a diagnosis other than fungal infection, please refer the case to a pharmacist. An off-label use may be approvable for a medication such as Nizoral for advanced prostate cancer or for Cushingâ€™s Syndrome when standard treatments have failed.
