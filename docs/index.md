This is a digital documentation example for Gainwell Technologies, in support of the Ohio State Pharmacy Benefit Management activity.

==Recent Update== (5/9/2023)

Documents under "UPDL and Supporting Documents" now contain new information pertaining to the drugs labeled, "BvG" (Brand Preferred over the Generic). 

If a drug in the "preferred drugs" category is listed as "BvG", then the generic drug in the "non-preferred drugs" category will be listed as "Brand Preferred". Hovering over a drug that is labeled with "Brand Preferred" will also display the brand preferred drug associated with it.
