Once the editor is opened, changes and updates can be made in any document. Changes to these documents are made through Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight formatting language that allows for additions of formatting elements to plain text documents. Simple notations are used to better format text and build structure within documents. The Markdown syntax is more thoroughly explained in text further below.

Switching between the editing and viewing tabs is also available which gives  users the ability to easily view the changes being made.

## Contributing Changes to Documents



## Markdown Syntax

### Headings 

Headings are creating by inputting hash marks before the desired heading text. The number of hash marks corresponds with the heading level of the text.

 - \# First Level Heading
 - \#\# Second Level Heading
 - \#\#\# Third Level Heading
 - \#\#\#\# Fourth Level Heading 

Displayed below is the outcome of using the correct Markdown syntax for creating headings.

### Lists

Lists are easily created using numbers or hyphens based on if the list is ordered or unordered. Indenting the syntax elements nests the list. Keyboard shortcuts are also available in creating lists. Pressing "Ctrl + Shift + 7" creates an ordered list, while pressing "Ctrl + Shift + 8" creates and unordered list.

- \- unordered list
- \- additional item on unordered list
- 1\. ordered list
- 2\. additional item on ordered list  

Displayed below is the outcome of using the correct Markdown systax for creating lists.

### Bold Text

Adding bold formatting to text is simply done by wrapping the text with two asterisks on each side of the text. A keyboard shortcut is also available to create bold text which can be utilized by pressing "Ctrl + B".

\*\*Bold Text**

### Tables

Creating and managing a table using Markdown requires a few syntax additions in order to display the correct formatting. A table is made up of vertical slashes, hyphens, and the desired text. Increasing the amount of vertical slashes increases the amount of columns formed in the table. The use of colons implements text alignment preferences to the table.

- | Correctly | Formatted | Table |
- | :--- | :---: | ---: |
- | information | inserted | here |
- | 1 | 2 | 3 |

Displayed below is the outcome of using the correct Markdown syntax for forming a table.
