The highlighted and starred sections are what is important to determine utilization, the remaining sections are additional information that is auto populated in  case the caller has questions. Below are the steps to give a better understanding of each of the  highlighted sections.</p> <p>Step 1: *QTY Received</p> <p>Column 1 is quantity received. This is the quantity of the original prescription filled at the pharmacy.</p> <p>Example: If the original fill was written as 60 tablets for 30 days, you will enter 60 in the quantity received section. </p> <p>Step 2: *Utilization % (in decimal)</p> <p>Column 2 is utilization % in decimal. This is the percentage of the medication that must be used for utilization to be met. For non-controlled medications, it must be 80% or 0.8 utilized. For controlled medications, it must be 90% or 0.9 utilized. </p> <p>Example: If the medication is dispensed is Adderall, 90% utilization must be met. If the medication dispensed is Duloxetine, 80% utilization must be met.</p> <p>Step 3: *Day Supply Reeived</p> <p>Column 3 is day supply received. This is the day supply of the original prescription filled at the pharmacy. </p> <p>Example: If the original fill was written as 60 tablets for 30 days, you will enter 30 in the day supply received section.</p> <p>Step 4: *Date of last claim </p> <p>Column 4 is date of last claim. This section is referring to the date the original claim was filled at the pharmacy. </p> <p>Example: If the last paid claim prior to the new claim was filled on 8/15/2024, this is the date that would be entered into this section.</p> <p>Step 5: *Date New DDU started</p> <p>Column 5 is date the new DDU started. This is the day the member started taking the new dose prescribed by the provider. This is not always the date the new script was sent in, and it is important to clarify this date with the pharmacy to ensure we are calculating correctly.</p> <p>Example: the member began T the new dose on 8/16/2024 but the new script was sent to the pharmacy on 8/25/2024. The date of 8/16/2024 will be entered into this section.</p> <p>**Step 6: *New DDU</p> <p>Column 6 is new DDU. This is the new daily dose that is being billed for the dosage increase. </p> <p>Example: The new script is being billed for 90 tablets for 30 days. The new DDU would be entered as 3. (DDU=quantity dispensed/day supply)</p> <p>Step 7: Soonest fill Date</p> <p>Column 7 is soonest fill date. This is the final section of the utilization tool. This date is provided when steps 1-6 are completed accurately. Provide this to the pharmacy as the date utilization will be met and the medication can be filled.</p> <p>Example:</p> <ol> <li>Quantity received - 60</li> <li>Utilization % (in decimal) - 0.8</li> <li>Day supply received \u2013 30</li> <li>Date of last claim \u2013 8/3/2024</li> <li>Date new DDU started \u2013 8/15/2024</li> <li>New DDU \u2013 4</li> <li>Soonest fill date \u2013 8/21/2024</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Clinical%20and%20Technical%20Reference%20Guide/Decision%20Pathways/Humira/","title":"Humira (adalimumab)","text":"<p>Decision Pathways should no longer be used for this medication and the UPDL should be used. </p>"},{"location":"Clinical%20and%20Technical%20Reference%20Guide/Decision%20Pathways/Semaglutide/","title":"Semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy)","text":"<p>Decision Pathways should no longer be used for this medication and the UPDL should be used. </p>"},{"location":"Clinical%20and%20Technical%20Reference%20Guide/FAQ/CSP/","title":"CSP","text":"<p>CSP Desk Level Procedures 7-6-2023</p>","boost":1},{"location":"Clinical%20and%20Technical%20Reference%20Guide/FAQ/CSP/#managed_care","title":"Managed Care","text":"<p>(Not for FFS Members)</p> <ul> <li>This is the EXACT verbiage ODM would like us to use<ul> <li>CSP edits are currently set to a \u201cWARN\u201d status, which means that claims are not rejecting at the point of sale due to using a non-designated provider.</li> <li>The MCE\u2019s may also request that a secondary or tertiary provider be added by our call center agents and will not be overridden by the daily file.</li> <li>A temporary change can be made to the primary provider at the request of the plan, however permanent primary designated pharmacies and prescribers must be submitted by the plan through the MITS application as any temporary change will be overridden by a daily file.</li> <li>Managed Care plans must make these changes and there is no override available that we can put in.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","boost":1},{"location":"Clinical%20and%20Technical%20Reference%20Guide/FAQ/CSP/#ffs_-_csp_members_only","title":"FFS - CSP Members ONLY","text":"<p>Definitions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Emergent: Essential to the maintenance of life or to the continuation of therapy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Non-emergent: Non acute or chronic medical condition, wellness maintenance and/or prescription refills that require medical intervention, when the member\u2019s condition is stable.</p> </li> <li> <p>CSP Team: Clinical pharmacist and pharmacy technician team members that oversee the CSP Program</p> </li> </ul> <p>Edit</p> <ul> <li>7121: RECIPIENT IS LOCKED-IN</li> <li>Only controlled medications will have a designated pharmacy lock-in.  </li> </ul> <p>Edit Overrides:</p> <p>Maximum of 3 edit overrides every 180 days for claims denied with edit 7121D: RECIPIENT LOCKED-IN.

It\u2019s often seen across all drugs in a GCN Seq No because newer drugs are automatically grandfathered into the DESI status of their drug/use case scenario.  Specifically with older drugs there will be one or two manufacturers that seek the required approvals on an older drug so that it\u2019s payable under Medicaid plans. But because older drugs are not automatically updated, it causes some hit-or-miss scenarios across drugs.</p> <p>https://www.fda.gov/drugs/enforcement-activities-fda/drug-efficacy-study-implementation-desi</p> <p>The link above further explains the situation with desi drugs that were approved for safe use prior to 1962, and it would seem there wasn\u2019t an incentive to go back and prove efficacious in some instances.</p> <p>So it appears that some of them have sought the necessary requirements to be approvable, and that is why they are green in our system at this time. From my recollection I believe there is a drug file updated weekly(I could be wrong) but the take away point is that these may be updated regularly and a possibility may arise that it was payable last week and not payable this week, the best way to know at the time is to look in NDC maintenance tile.</p> <p>I did get an example of a payable NDC not rejecting for DESI status in a typically DESI status GCNSeqNO, but did give the PA warning. So this means in time there will be PA requirements stopping these payable medications, at least in the one example I could come up with.</p> <p>So as of now, If we get prior authorizations for what was once thought totally DESI, if there are green payable NDCs in that GCNSeqNO, I would not deny for admin denial DESI criteria, but process as a normal PA would be and strongly suggest if approving to include something like this in the APPROVAL LETTER Letter Text section:</p> <p>Please note that claims must be processed for a payable NDC to provide a successful claim submission</p> <p>There may be questions from pharmacies/providers about if a PA gets approved for this situation but I imagine they will need to use a payable NDC, which can be found in an NDC tile GCNSeqNO search. There maybe issues where if they are older approvals and NDCs used that pharmacies my not be able to acquire a payable one, but this is similar to any situation involving supply issues of payable medications.</p>","boost":1},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Clinical%20and%20PA%20Notes/Dexcom/","title":"Dexcom 10/15/22","text":"<p>The only thing if I may add is that ODM pays for the Receiver or reader every 3 years so I put a 1095 day supply on it.</p> <ul> <li>DexCom, Inc. 08627-0091-11 DexCom G6 Receiver \u2013 this is only needed one time per year ((Indicated for one-year use)</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>This is on the OHUPDL Diabetic Supply List with the following criteria:</p> <p>The following practice standards warrant CGM usage:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Must have had appointment with provider within past 6 months AND</p> <ul> <li>Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes OR</li> <li>Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and require insulin dose adjustment within the last 12 months, or have significant inability to adequately monitor blood glucose via fingerstick, or not require prandial insulin with A1c &gt;7% OR</li> <li>History of significant or recurring hypoglycemia</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>When reviewing, use the NDC provided:</p> <ul> <li>DexCom, Inc. 08627-0016-01 DexCom G6 Transmitter \u2013 (Indicated for three-month use) (refill every 3 months)</li> <li>DexCom, Inc. 08627-0053-03 DexCom G6 Sensor \u2013 1, 3-pack of Sensors: With a 10-day sensor life, patients will need to replace sensors every 10 days - refill every 30 days</li> <li>DexCom, Inc. 08627-0091-11 DexCom G6 Receiver \u2013 this is only needed one time per year ((Indicated for one-year use)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Reference - https://provider.dexcom.com/education-research/clinic-resources/prescribing-info/how-fill-dexcom-g6-pharmacy-prescription</p>","boost":1},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Clinical%20and%20PA%20Notes/Emgality/","title":"Emgality for training 4/19/23","text":"<p>Hello,</p> <p>It has been clarified that when approving Emgality for cluster HA, we are to allow 3 doses of 100mg every month for 180 days.

Many of the tech consult questions regarding edits involving things like edits 7026 and 7376 can be researched and addressed without involving pharmacists in pharmacist consult chat. Last week was a surprise to us all with the overwhelming calls of quantity limit edits, but in opioid situations many things are defined as requiring a PA. Please do not indicate that PAs are not required when a days supply issue or quantity edit override is required. Please be mindful of when a PA is required with working with these medications, in the case of the UPDL, preferred medications do not always mean a PA is not required, especially in these instances. Any thing that is indicated requiring a PA, above quantity limit, not within established age limits, DAW requests, or anything else specifically stated in the UPDL, Additional Criteria, Quantity limits, or Med Nec policy needs to be handled with a PA and these information sources should be used to direct and guide all (pharmacies, precribers, members, Gainwell employees) in determining the appropriate course of action.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>","boost":1},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Clinical%20and%20PA%20Notes/Control%20Substances/Rx%20Law/","title":"Ohio Rx laws","text":"<p>Information can also be found in the provider reference guide.</p> <p>OH Prescription length Laws:</p> <ul> <li>CII (Narcotic) - 14 days from date written (partial fill must be completed within 30 days) </li> <li>CII (Non-narcotic) - 6 months (partial fill must be completed within 30 days) </li> <li>C3-5 - 6 months, Non-controlled Rx - 1 year.  </li> </ul> <p>All Non-CII Rxs must be have 1st fill within first 6 months from date written.</p> <p></p>","boost":1},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Clinical%20and%20PA%20Notes/Diabetes/A1C%20in%20diabetic/","title":"A1c in Diabetic decisioning 4/3/23","text":"<p>Hello,</p> <p>The question was brought up about the vagueness of A1c in decisioning for diabetic medications, specifically the portion given on UPDL \u2013 </p> <p></p> <p>Where goal was not very clearly defined. </p> <p>It was discussed that a great number like 6 or 5 would probably indicate a goal with initiation of therapy, but this is probably not likely the most appropriate scenario, especially if starting out at a higher 10-12, no one drug will be able to go down that much on average.

It appears that we have had a lot of approvals for non-formulary test strips, specifically the Freestyle Precision Neo that is compatible with the Freestyle Libre CGM system. Many of these PA\u2019s are stating they are requesting as member has Libre and   this is the only compatible test strip for this system.</p> <p>I asked ODM what we should be doing when we get these specific requests so that we may have more direction moving forward. They specifically stated that these requests should be denied and that we recommend the formulary test strips and meters. This requires the member to have a formulary meter and formulary test strips to use in that meter vs. using the strips compatible with the Freestyle Libre CGM. @Carpenter, Rachel\u2013 Can we modify the denial language for these somehow to indicate that we understand that they are trying to use these with the Libre system, but that the member will need to use a formulary meter and formulary strips instead, both of which we cover? </p> <p>I am placing a screenshot below for the formulary products.

Last week I said I would provide situations in which to approve or deny by the different ways to clear things up a bit for technicians and newer people. </p> <p>Basically if a technician is moving a PA through the ques, please use GCNseqNO, if you are to be the final decider, be it technician or pharmacist, you must adjust at what level you are to decide. This makes it easier on the techs that are moving things through to be uniform, and those specialized enough to approve or deny to apply. From most general to strict, it goes HICL-GCN-NDC.</p> <p>HICLseqNO \u2013 we want to use when there is going to be multiple strengths or vials used in a period, like different vials of a factor, the 56 and 84 doses of Spravato that can be changed based on last appointment, or an initial and continuing dosage of Humira for 90 days initial PA. This allows the freedom to use these vials and relies on quantity in the PA to control the amount dispensed. </p> <p>GCNseqNO \u2013 what most of our approvals or denials should be. This is generally in place for multiple generic use at the pharmacy level, meaning if we approve a non-preferred medication, it doesn\u2019t matter who makes it (Teva, Mylan) the pharmacy can dispense it. This is why if you approve at NDC level the pharmacy will call back and need it fixed at their next shipment time when they get a different manufacturer. If able, do not approve at NDC level.</p> <p>NDC \u2013 this is when a specific NDC is needed to be approved or denied, as in the cases of DAW1, they only want the brand. For BvG we must and pharmacy must process for the preferred brand name with DAW 9, meaning the plan prefers the medication. For diabetic testing supplies, all the test strips have the same GCNseqNO, and must be specified at the NDC level when doing PAs.</p> <p>Again, when moving from fax/pending or anywhere else in Vue360rx, please use GCNseqNO, and if approving please use the guidance for the appropriate times. If you have questions in specificity for processing/approving/denying(pharmacists), please contact your leads.</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks,</p> <p>Justin Collingwood</p>","boost":1},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Medication%20Guidance/HICL/#dermatologic_agents_oral_acne_products_71523","title":"Dermatologic Agents: Oral Acne Products 7/15/23","text":"<p>Weekly email 7/15/23</p> <p>All the medications in the category Dermatologic Agents: Oral Acne Products are to be approved at GcnseqNO, there are DAW edits in place to stop the use of Absorica and Absorica LD</p>","boost":1},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Medication%20Guidance/Meds%20with%20no%20pf/","title":"PA Guidance for medications with no preferred alternatives 5/23/23","text":"<p>Good morning!!</p> <p>@OH Supervisors and Sr. Techs \u2013 please forward this email to your PA techs for their visibility and understanding</p> <p>Guidance for PA technicians: Ztalmy, Hyftor and Nucala requests should be sent to MEDREVIEW for pharmacist review. </p>"},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Medication%20Guidance/Meds%20with%20no%20pf/#guidance_for_pa_pharmacists","title":"Guidance for PA pharmacists","text":"<p>The below medications do have certain indications to which there are no appropriate alternatives (noted below).

This condition reduces the ability of the patient to digest foods that contain sugars or starches. The enzyme, sucrase-isomaltase, can be completely absent or in very low levels of activity.</p> <p>When the sucrase and isomaltase enzymes have low or nonexistent activity, it can cause many gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including diarrhea, gas, bloating, and abdominal pain. The symptoms of CSID typically manifest in late infancy or early childhood. Onset of symptoms is directly related to food consumption of the child. In exclusively breast-fed babies, symptoms may not begin until sucrose-containing foods are introduced into the diet. Some patients may experience more mild symptoms, which can lead to the condition not being diagnosed until adulthood. In addition, given the nonspecific symptoms of CSID, the condition is often misdiagnosed as other functional GI disorders, and CSID diagnosis is not confirmed until later on in the course of the disease. Once CSID begins to be suspected, diagnosis can be made through several mechanisms, including intestinal biopsy, carbon-13 (C13) breath test, or through genetic testing.</p> <p>A complicating factor in diagnosis is deciphering between congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency and acquired/secondary sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (SID). Acquired SID can result from gastrointestinal disorders, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, or even acute gastroenteritis. The symptoms of SID should resolve once the underlying etiology is addressed. Currently, most diagnostic modalities cannot decipher between the acquired and congenital forms, which presents a complicating factor to health plans when approaching Sucraid approval. Sucraid is indicated in the treatment of CSID specifically, and efficacy has not been established in the acquired SID form.</p> <p>Is there a gold standard for diagnosis that is able to decipher between the congenital and acquired forms of sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (SID)?</p> <ul> <li>There does not currently exist an accessible, standard diagnostic test that is able to decipher between the two forms. This presents a difficulty to payers, as this distinction is important in issuing approval for Sucraid. Sucraid is a treatment specifically for CSID. Since acquired SID occurs as a result of an underlying pathology (e.g. celiac disease), patients are not often treated for SID, but rather treatment of the underlying etiology is targeted with the hope that it will cause resolution of SID.</li> <li> <p>To our knowledge, there is only one approach to truly decipher between the acquired and congenital forms, and that is through sequencing the entire SI gene. Conducting this is not commonplace in practice and is also not an accessible option to all patients. In addition, to sequence an entire gene is expensive, and may not be a necessary or cost-effective approach to ensuring accurate diagnosis.</p> <ul> <li>CSID is caused by a mutation in the SI gene on chromosome 3. CSID is an autosomal-recessive condition; however, there are some heterozygotes that will experience symptoms, albeit less severe. In North America, there appear to be four common mutations that account for the majority of CSID cases. A study found that there is an 83% probability that an individual of European descent with CSID will have one of these four mutations.</li> <li> <p>When approaching genetic testing, is important to distinguish whether the test sequences the entire SI gene or whether it is just a panel of the four common mutations. If it is the latter, there is a possibility that a true CSID patient will not be identified. The price discrepancy between these two are quite significant, with one source stating the entire SI sequence costs approximately $8,000 and the panel of the four common mutations costs around $1,000.</p> <ul> <li>The cost, availability, and accuracy of the genetic tests may impact payer decisions to require this as a diagnostic criterion. It does appear as though the gold standard for CSID diagnosis remains the small intestinal biopsy, even though it is unable to decipher between the types. If a request is sent to the plan for Sucraid when the patient has already had genetic testing conducted and CSID diagnosis ascertained, it would appear appropriate to accept this as an accurate means of diagnosis. But requiring such testing has many factors to consider, mentioned above. </li> <li>It would appear reasonable to defer to the clinical judgment of the treating physician in regard to whether the SID is congenital or acquired. A criterion to implement may be to require this specification through attestation in the documentation for approval.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Management Opportunities and Strategies</p> <ul> <li>Most large payers do have criteria in place for Sucraid.</li> <li>The most common criterion is a diagnosis of CSID, with some payers specifically calling out secondary/acquired SID as a condition for which Sucraid is not covered.</li> <li>Other common criteria involve the confirmation of SID diagnosis through intestinal biopsy, C13 breath test, or meeting other specified criteria from the Sucraid package insert (stool pH &lt;6, an increase in breath hydrogen &gt;10 ppm when challenged with sucrose after fasting, and a negative lactose breath test).</li> </ul> <p>References:</p> <p>ipdanalytics.com</p> <p>https://www.sucraid.com/</p> <p>Lexi</p>","boost":1},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Medication%20Guidance/Systemic%20Immunomodulators/","title":"Immunomodulators for Systemic Inflammatory Disease DLP","text":"<p>9/15/23- Must use Decision Pathway for Humira</p>","boost":1},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Medication%20Guidance/Systemic%20Immunomodulators/#11623","title":"11/6/23","text":"<p>Weekly Email 11/05/23</p> <p>\u2022   Some biologics require initial IV dosing or dosing that would be covered by medical.

If a peer to peer request is needed with a pharmacist, it is the responsibility of the pharmacist who decisioned the PA to take the peer to peer call (whether it be immediately, or a call back). If the pharmacist who decisioned the case is not available (OOO, at lunch, etc.), it is the responsibility of the pharmacist in the chat to take the peer to peer. We should ALWAYS be performing the peer to peer when it is convenient for the prescriber/provider and not at our convenience (whether this be immediately or a call back \u2013 whichever the prescriber/provider prefers). Pharmacists are then to document the peer to peer interaction on the internal tracker.</p> <p>2.    A technician should NEVER refuse to allow the provider to perform a peer to peer. It is on the denial letter for every provider that they have the right to perform a peer to peer. We have been told that technicians are advising that we are \u201ccracking down\u201d on the amount of peer to peers we are allowing \u2013 this is NOT the case!</p> <p>Most of the time, the provider is wanting to provide additional information to support the PA request via peer to peer (they are not just calling to complain).

Also ignore any urgent or vacation override requests. We in this chat know they do not belong here.</p> <p>8/16/23- Email \"Taking Responsibility\"</p> <p>Hello! We need to better tech processes. I have given warnings and brought training opportunities to light, and they are still not getting better with time. This will no longer happen. I am collecting daily problems I will send out to the technician supervisors. Situations I am seeing still.</p> <p>1.    P2P \u2013 Per the DLP technicians must fully understand why the PA was denied and specifically focus on that information per our DLP.</p> <p></p> <p>This will be in every P2P posted in tech chat from now on: Reason for Denial on PA in VUE: Information gathered from prescriber when asked the specific reason it was denied:</p> <p>I realize there may be some you will not be able to approve, but to save time and be more efficient, the pharmacist in tech chat can read the denial reason and if provided sufficient information if a PA can be approved, and the technician can enter that information and approve the PA in view, and stop it there.</p> <p>This information will be collected.</p> <p>Pharmacists - you must clearly state in your denial language what you are missing on the path to approval.</p> <p>There will not be an increase of straight to pharmacist or med director p2ps. I will look at those that are sent straight to the pharmacist and if the person on the other side of the phone does not specifically say \u201cI want to speak to a pharmacist\u201d, \u201cI need the medical director\u201d, \u201cThis needs to be reviewed by a pharmacist\u201d are not said, I will be contacting quality. Situations that will no longer happen = \u201cLet me get a hold of a pharmacist for you\u201d, \u201cWe can do a peer to peer for this\u201d(and not accepting the PA for yourself to handle) etc are not acceptable, you offer the service, you complete it.</p> <p>WE are not cracking down on peer to peer numbers, I am cracking down on the PROCESSING of peer to peers, and how it needs to be better and follow the dlp. Every request still needs to be processed, the prescribers have that right. Technicians should be able to approve common sense answers like \u201call they need is pulmonary hypertension diagnosis\u201d or \u201cif a TB test was done\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t approve this because a pharmacist denied\u201d is and was never a viable reason, every denial will be coming from a pharmacist.</p> <p>PAs are still being segmented, many times it has been stated that this is as easy as hitting equals before submitting. This must happen, if approved for segmented it greatly hinders the ability to pick up medications.</p> <p>It is the responsibility of the technicians to verify first the member/prescriber/drug/diagnosis/MISSING signature(please notice the missing). The part of this is that drugs and diagnosis codes must be added, prescribers IDs and member ids and eligibilities must be verified and CURRENT. If member has primary or coordination of benefits issues, this does not come to medreview, even if a medreview auto drug, coverage/eligibility determines the primary source of payment for this.</p> <p>Multiple faxes on one PA \u2013 this is a technician responsibility as well, it is on evergreen - Splitting Faxes this is your responsibility to see that there are multiple faxes and to divide them appropriately.</p> <p>DO NOT simply take prior approved or denied PAs and send them to medreview. If a PA needs to have information provided or any other reason to be provided to decision, a new PA MUST be created.</p> <p>I have, especially the peer to peer portion, reminded and reminded situations that have been happening and it does not seem to be sinking in. In efforts to push the responsibilities that are the technicians, the responsibility of coming outside of turn around time is going to be placed on the technician and their leads in these following situations.</p>"},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Policy%20and%20Procedures/PA%20signatures/","title":"PA signatures","text":""},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Policy%20and%20Procedures/PA%20signatures/#pa_signatures","title":"PA Signatures","text":"<p>NEVER cancel a PA for a missing signature</p>"},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Policy%20and%20Procedures/PA%20signatures/#accept_signature_if_the_pa_has_atleast_one_of_the_following_three_elements","title":"Accept \"signature\" if the PA has atleast ONE of the following three elements:","text":"<ul> <li>Signature<ul> <li>any marking on the line is acceptable, including typed signatures</li> </ul> </li> <li>Printed Name</li> <li>Attestation box Marked </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Pharmacist%20Reference%20Guide/Policy%20and%20Procedures/PA%20signatures/#techs_send_the_following_pas_to_med_review_using_appropriate_template_and_notes","title":"Techs send the following PAs to \"Med Review\", using appropriate template and notes","text":"<ul> <li>The PA has ZERO of the above three elements</li> <li>The signature is obviously from a Pharmacist at the dispensing Pharmacy<ul> <li>Pharmacists CAN prescribe in Ohio and CAN submit Prior Authorizations.
